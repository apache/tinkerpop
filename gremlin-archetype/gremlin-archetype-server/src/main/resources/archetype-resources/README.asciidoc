= Gremlin Server Application

This is a starter project that demonstrates how a basic
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/${project.version}/reference/#gremlin-server[Gremlin Server] project is structured
with Maven. This project demonstrates how to connect to Gremlin Server with Java using remote traversals with the
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/${project.version}/reference/#connecting-via-remotegraph[Gremlin Driver] that is
distributed by TinkerPop.

== Prerequisites

* Java 8 Update 40+
* link:https://maven.apache.org/[Maven 3.x]
* Gremlin Server is link:http://archive.apache.org/dist/tinkerpop/[downloaded] and unpackaged

== Building and Running

Build the project as follows:

[source,text]
mvn clean package

Start Gremlin Server in the directory it was unpackaged and specify usage of the "modern" graph configuration:

[source,text]
$ bin/gremlin-server.sh  conf/gremlin-server-modern.yaml
