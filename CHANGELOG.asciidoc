* Added grammar-based `Translator` for all languages including explicit ones for Java and anonymization.
* Removed old `Translator` infrastructure.
* Removed grammar support for enums to be used as variables.
* Changed `valueMap` in grammar to disallow the `boolean` argument as a variable to avoid ambiguous step calls.

* Added new list filtering step `none()`.
* Replaced `gremlin-groovy` with `gremlin-lang` as the default language in `gremlin-server`.
* Changed `sum()` to retain the type common to the stream rather than always promoting to `long` given the need for it to multiple by the `long` bulk value for the traverser.
* Added support for `Set` in GraphSON and GraphBinary serialization for `gremlin-javascript`, where it previously just converted to array.
* Added `Set` syntax in `gremlin-language`.
* Modified RequestInterceptor to be a `UnaryOperator<HttpRequest>` to abstract the underlying implementation.

* Modified the Gremlin ANTLR grammar to more dynamically interact with any strategies registered globally to the `TraversalStrategies` cache sets.

* Removed serialization support for `Bindings` and `Bytecode`.
* Changed `EmbeddedRemoteConnection` to prefer the grammar-based translator.

* Added missing strategies to the `TraversalStrategies` global cache as well as `CoreImports` in `gremlin-groovy`.
* Added missing strategies to `strategies.py` in `gremlin-python`.
* Updated `OptionsStrategy` in `gremlin-python` to take options directly as keyword arguments.
* Added static `instance()` method to `ElementIdStrategy` to an instance with the default configuration.
* Updated `ElementIdStrategy.getConfiguration()` to help with serialization.
* Updated `TraversalStrategyProxy` to utilize strategy names instead of strategy classes
* Established mechanism for using customer strategies in remote context by using `TraversalStrategyProxy` in Java, or `TraversalStrategy` in GLVs.
