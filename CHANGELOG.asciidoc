* Added an `AnonymizingTypeTranslator` for use with `GroovyTranslator` which strips PII (anonymizes any String, Numeric, Date, Timestamp, or UUID data)
* Added support for `g.tx()` in Python.
* Added logging in in Python.
* Added `tx()` syntax to `gremlin-language`.
* Fixed shutdown cleanup issue in Python aiohttp transport layer.
* Added a `NoSugarTranslator` translator to `PythonTranslator` which translates Gremlin queries to Python without syntactic sugar (ex `g.V().limit(1)` instead of `g.V()[0:1]`)
* Added support for `g.Tx()` in .NET.
* Added support for `with()` constant options to `io()`.
* Changed `GroovyTranslator` to generate code more compatible to Java with `Date` and `Timestamp`.
* Fixed bug in the processing of the `io()` step when constructing a `Traversal` from the grammar.
* Added the `ConnectedComponent` tokens required to properly process the `with()` of the `connectedComponent()` step.
* Fixed `DotNetTranslator` bugs where translations produced Gremlin that failed due to ambiguous step calls to `has()`.
* Fixed bug where `RepeatUnrollStrategy`, `InlineFilterStrategy` and `MessagePassingReductionStrategy` were all being applied more than necessary.
* Modified grammar to accept the `datetime()` function so that Gremlin scripts have a way to natively construct a `Date`.
* Ensured `PathRetractionStrategy` is applied after `InlineFilterStrategy` which prevents an error in traverser mapping in certain conditions.
* Deprecated `JsonBuilder` serialization for GraphSON and Gryo.
* Added `ProductiveByStrategy` to ensure consistency of `by()` modulator behaviors when child traversal arguments contained no elements.
* Changed drivers to once again send the previously deprecated and removed "close" message for sessions.
* Modified `fold()` to merge `Map` instances with `addAll`.
* Allowed `null` string values in the Gremlin grammar.
* Fixed support for `SeedStrategy` in the Gremlin Grammar.
* Fixed bug in `Translator` of `gremlin-javascript` around array translation.
* Fixed bugs in `PythonTranslator`, `JavascriptTranslator` and `DotNetTranslator` when translating `TraversalStrategy` objects to Javascript.
* Prevented exception with `hasLabel(null)` and `hasKey(null)` and instead filter away traversers as these structural components can't ever be null.
* Improved handling of `null` when passed to `P` predicates.
* Handled `null` for mathematical reducing operations of `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()` and `min()`.
* Allowed `null` values in `Memory` for `GraphComputer`.
* Allowed `null` assignment in `withSideEffect()`.
* Allowed labelling of steps that emit a traverser carrying `null`.
* Fixed bug in filtering for `null` property key arguments to `valueMap()`, `elementMap()`, `properties()` and `values()`.
* Modified grammar to allow a call to `within()` and `without()` with no arguments.
* Fixed problems with `inject(null)` variations where `null` was the only value being submitted.
* Fixed problem with `GroovyTranslator` and `inject(null,null)` which could be interpreted as the Groovy JDK extension `inject(Object,Closure)`.
* Fixed error where certain variants of `inject()` with `null` might not properly construct a traversal in .NET.
* Prevented exception with  `hasValue(null)` and allowed filtering as expected.
* Refined `DotNetTranslator` to be more explicit with `null` arguments to ensure that the right overloads are called.
* Created `GremlinParser` to construct `Traversal` objects from `gremlin-language`.
* Added `GremlinLangScriptEngine` as a `GremlinScriptEngine` implementation that users the grammar and `JavaTranslator` to evaluate Gremlin.
* Added getter method for `bypassTraversal` in `AbstractLambdaTraversal`.
* Added support for custom GraphBinary types in .NET.
* Removed some unnecessary exception wrapping around `gremlin-driver` errors now producing a more immediate view of the actual error cause.

* Added `gremlin-language` module.
* Allowed the possibility for the propagation of `null` as a `Traverser` in Gremlin.
* Added a fully shaded version of `gremlin-driver`.
* Exposed websocket connection status in JavaScript driver.
* Fixed a bug where spark-gremlin was not re-attaching properties when using `dedup()`.
* Fixed a bug in `WsAndHttpChannelizer` pipeline configuration where failed object aggregation could not write back HTTP responses.
* Ensured better consistency of the use of `null` as arguments to mutation steps.
* Added a `ResponseStatusCode` to indicate that a client should retry its request.
* Added `TemporaryException` interface to indicate that a transaction can be retried.
* Prevented `TraversalStrategy` instances from being added more than once, where the new instance replaces the old.

* Improved error message for `addE()` when cardinality is specified on `property()` assignments.
* Allowed `property(T.label,Object)` to be used if no value was supplied to `addV(String)`.
* Dropped support for .NET Standard 1.3 in Gremlin.Net. Only .NET Standard 2.0 is supported starting with this version.
* Added GraphBinary support for .NET.
* Added `UnifiedChannelizer` which exposes HTTP and Websockets connections and processes both sessionless and in-session requests with the same `gremlinPool`.
* Bounded the `gremlinPool` in Gremlin Server to enforce rate limiting which will then produce a `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` response status code.

* Added `SeedStrategy` to allow deterministic behavior for `coin()`, `sample()` and `Order.shuffle`.
* Added `Grouping` step interface.
* Added `TraversalParent.replaceTraversal()` which can replace a direct child traversal.
* Added `ByModulatorOptimizationStrategy` which replaces certain standard traversals w/ optimized traversals (e.g. `TokenTraversal`).
* Improved `IdentityRemovalStrategy` by accounting for `EndStep` situations.
* Added `IdentityRemovalStrategy` to the standard list of `TraversalStrategies`.
* Modified `PathRetractionStrategy` to leave labels more often with `match()` cases to return more consistent results.
* Refactored `MapStep` to move its logic to `ScalarMapStep` so that the old behavior could be preserved while allow other implementations to have more flexibility.
* Modified TinkerGraph to support `null` property values and can be configured to disable that feature.
* Modified `null` handling in mutations to be consistent for a new `Vertex` as well as update to an existing one.
* Enforced use of anonymous child traversals.
* Removed support for Python 2.x in gremlinpython.
* Upgraded to Apache Commons Configuration2.
* Renamed `StoreStep` to `AggregateLocalStep`.
* Renamed `AggregateStep` to `AggregateGlobalStep`.

* Bumped to Neo4j 3.4.11.
* Bumped to Spark 3.0.0.
* Bumped to Jackson 2.11.x.

* Added a kerberos KDC to the docker container for testing GLV's.
* Added kerberos authentication to Gremlin-Python.
* Added audit logging to bytecode-based traversals.
* Changed `TraversalStrategy` application methodology to apply each strategy in turn to each level of the traversal hierarchy starting from root down to children.
* Added a VertexProgramRestrictionStrategy.
* Prevented more than one `Client` from connecting to the same Gremlin Server session.
* Changed the Groovy to an optional dependency in `gremlin-driver`.

* Added `gremlint` module to house the Gremlin query formatting JavaScript library powering gremlint.com.
* Removed internal functionality for the session close message in Gremlin Server - the message is accepted but ignored if sent.
* Removed `Property.Exceptions.propertyValueCanNotBeNull` exception type as `null` now has meaning in Gremlin.

* Added a `Lambda` class to Gremlin.Net that makes it possible to use Groovy and Python lambdas with Gremlin.Net.
* Enums are now represented as classes in Gremlin.Net which allows to use them as arguments in more steps.
* Bumped to Groovy 2.4.14.
* Added `checkAdjacentVertices` option to `SubgraphStrategy`.
* Modified `GremlinDslProcessor` so that it generated the `getAnonymousTraversalClass()` method to return the DSL version of `__`.
* Added the "Kitchen Sink" test data set.
* Fixed deserialization of `P.not()` for GraphSON.
* Bumped to Jackson 2.9.4.
* Improved performance of `JavaTranslator` by caching reflected methods required for traversal construction.
* Ensure that `RemoteStrategy` is applied before all other `DecorationStrategy` instances.
* Added `idleConnectionTimeout` and `keepAliveInterval` to Gremlin Server that enables a "ping" and auto-close for seemingly dead clients.
* Fixed a bug where lambdas in `gremlin-python` would trigger a failure if steps using python-only symbols were present (such as `as_()`).
* Fixed a bug in `NumberHelper` that led to wrong min/max results if numbers exceeded the Integer limits.
* Delayed setting of the request identifier until `RequestMessage` construction by the builder.
* `ReferenceElement` avoids `UnsupportedOperationException` handling in construction thus improving performance.
* Improved error messaging for failed serialization and deserialization of request/response messages.
* Fixed handling of `Direction.BOTH` in `Messenger` implementations to pass the message to the opposite side of the `StarGraph`.
* Removed hardcoded expectation in metrics serialization test suite as different providers may have different outputs.
* Added `IndexedTraverserSet` which indexes on the value of a `Traverser` thus improving performance when used.
* Utilized `IndexedTraverserSet` in `TraversalVertexProgram` to avoid extra iteration when doing `Vertex` lookups.
* Bumped to Netty 4.0.56.Final.
* Fixed .NET GraphSON serialization of `P.Within()` and `P.without()` when passing a `Collection` as an argument.
* Fixed a bug in Gremlin Console which prevented handling of `gremlin.sh` flags that had an "=" between the flag and its arguments.
* Fixed bug where `SparkMessenger` was not applying the `edgeFunction` from `MessageScope`.
* Fixed a bug in `ComputerAwareStep` that didn't handle `reset()` properly and thus occasionally produced some extra traversers.
* Removed `TraversalPredicate` class in Gremlin.Net. It is now included in the `P` class instead.

* Fixed a `String` bug in `GroovyTranslator` and `PythonTranslator` where if the string has double-quotes it now uses """ """.
* Added a default `TraversalStrategy.getConfiguration()` which returns the configuration needed to construct the strategy.
* `Computer` instances can be created with `Computer.create(Configuration)` and accessed via `Computer.getConf()`.
* Every `TraversalStrategy` can be created via a `Configuration` and a static `MyStrategy.create(Configuration)`.
* Added language-agnostic `TraversalStrategy` support in `Bytecode`.
* Added `PartitionStrategy.Builder.readPartitions()` and deprecated `PartitionStrategy.Builder.addPartition()`.
* A new version of `LazyBarrierStrategy` has been created and added to the default strategies.

[[release-3-2-0-incubating]]
=== TinkerPop 3.2.0 (Release Date: April 8, 2016)

This release also includes changes from <<release-3-1-2-incubating, 3.1.2-incubating>>.

* Bumped to Neo4j 2.3.3.
* Renamed variable `local` to `fs` in `HadoopGremlinPlugin` to avoid a naming conflict with `Scope.local`. *(breaking)*
* Added `GraphTraversal.optional()` which will use the inner traversal if it returns results, else it won't.
* `GroupStep` and `GroupSideEffectStep` make use of mid-traversal reducers to limit memory consumption in OLAP.
* Added `GraphTraversal.program(VertexProgram)` to allow arbitrary user vertex programs in OLAP.
* Added `GraphTraversal.project()` for creating a `Map<String,E>` given the current traverser and an arbitrary number of `by()`-modulators.
* `HADOOP_GREMLIN_LIBS` can now reference a directory in HDFS and will be used if the directory does not exist locally.
* Added `gremlin-benchmark` module with JMH benchmarking base classes that can be used for further benchmark development.
* `TraversalStrategies.GlobalCache` supports both `Graph` and `GraphComputer` strategy registrations.
* `select("a","b").by("name").by("age")`-style traversals now work in OLAP with new `PathProcessorStrategy`.
* `DedupGlobalStep` can now handle star-bound `by()`-modulators and scoped keys on `GraphComputer`.
* Added `Computer` which is a builder for `GraphComputers` that is serializable.
* `PersistedOutputRDD` now implements `PersistResultGraphAware` and thus, no more unneeded warnings when using it.
* Renamed `StandardTraversalMetrics` to `DefaultTraversalMetrics` given the `DefaultXXX`-convention throughout. *(breaking)*
* Bumped to Apache Hadoop 2.7.2.
* Fixed a bug around profiling and nested traversals.
* Added `gremlin.hadoop.defaultGraphComputer` so users can use `graph.compute()` with `HadoopGraph`.
* Added `gremlin.hadoop.graphReader` and `gremlin.hadoop.graphWriter` which can handled `XXXFormats` and `XXXRDDs`.
* Deprecated `gremlin.hadoop.graphInputFormat`, `gremlin.hadoop.graphOutputFormat`, `gremlin.spark.graphInputRDD`, and `gremlin.spark.graphOutputRDD`.
* If no configuration is provided to `HadoopPools` it uses the default configuration to create a pool once and only once per JVM.
* Implemented `RemoteGraph`, `RemoteConnection`, and `RemoteStrategy`.
* Added validation to `GryoMapper` Kryo identifiers before construction to prevent accidental duplicates.
* Added `GraphStep.addIds()` which is useful for `HasContainer` "fold ins."
* Added a static `GraphStep.processHashContainerIds()` helper for handling id-based `HasContainers`.
* `GraphStep` implementations should have `g.V().hasId(x)` and `g.V(x)` compile equivalently. *(breaking)*
* Optimized `ExpandableStepIterator` with simpler logic and increased the likelihood of bulking.
* Optimized `TraverserRequirement` calculations.
* `Step.addStart()` and `Step.addStarts()` now take `Traverser.Admin<S>` and `Traverser.Admin<S>`, respectively. *(breaking)*
* `Step.processNextStart()` and `Step.next()` now return `Traverser.Admin<E>`. *(breaking)*
* `Traversal.addTraverserRequirement()` method removed. *(breaking)*
* Fixed a `hashCode()` bug in `OrderGlobalStep` and `OrderLocalStep`.
* Added `OrderLimitStrategy` which will ensure that partitions are limited before being merged in OLAP.
* `ComparatorHolder` now separates the traversal from the comparator. *(breaking)*
* Bumped to Apache Spark 1.6.1.
* If no Spark serializer is provided then `GryoSerializer` is the default, not `JavaSerializer`.
* Added `Operator.sumLong` as a optimized binary operator intended to be used by `Memory` reducers that know they are dealing with longs.
* Traversers from `ComputerResultStep` are no longer attached. Attaching is only used in TinkerPop's test suite via `System.getProperties()`.
* Fixed a `hashCode()`/`equals()` bug in `MessageScope`.
* Fixed a severe `Traversal` cloning issue that caused inconsistent `TraversalSideEffects`.
* `TraversalSideEffects` remain consistent and usable across multiple chained OLAP jobs.
* Added `MemoryTraversalSideEffects` which wraps `Memory` in a `TraversalSideEffects` for use in OLAP.
* `TraversalSideEffects` are now fully functional in OLAP save that an accurate global view is possible at the start of an iteration (not during).
* Updated the `TraversalSideEffects` API to support registered reducers and updated `get()`-semantics. *(breaking)*
* Split existing `profile()` into `ProfileStep` and `ProfileSideEffectStep`.
* The `profile()`-step acts like a reducing barrier and emits `TraversalMetrics` without the need for `cap()`. *(breaking)*
* Added `LocalBarrier` interface to allow traversers to remain distributed during an iteration so as to reduce cluster traffic.
* Added `NoOpBarrierStep` as a `LocalBarrier` implementation of `LambdaCollectingBarrierStep(noOp)`.
* `AggregateStep` implements `LocalBarrier` and thus, doesn't needlessly communicate its barrier traversers.
* Fixed an OLAP-based `Barrier` synchronization bug.
* Fixed a semantic bug in `BranchStep` (and inheriting steps) where barriers reacted locally. *(breaking)*
* Added `MemoryComputeKey` for specification of `Memory` keys in `VertexProgram`. *(breaking)*
* Added `VertexComputeKey` for specification of vertex compute properties in `VertexProgram`. *(breaking)*
* Added `and`, `or`, and `addAll` to `Operator`.
* `Memory` API changed to support setting and adding values for reduction. *(breaking)*
* `Memory` keys can be marked as broadcast and only those values are sent to workers on each iterator.
* `Memory` keys can be marked transient and thus deleted at the end of the OLAP job.
* Vertex compute keys can be marked transient and thus deleted at the end of the OLAP job.
* `VertexProgram` API changed to support `MemoryComputeKey` and `VertexComputeKey`. *(breaking)*
* `TraversalVertexProgram` able to execute OLAP and OLTP traversal sections dynamically within the same job.
* Removed `FinalGet` interface as all post processing of reductions should be handled by the reducing step explicitly. *(breaking)*
* Simplified all `SupplyingBarrierStep` implementations as they no longer require `MapReduce` in OLAP.
* Simplified all `CollectingBarrierStep` implementations as they no longer require `MapReduce` in OLAP.
* Simplified all `ReducingBarrierStep` implementations as they no longer require `MapReduce` in OLAP.
* All steps in OLAP that used `MapReduce` now use `Memory` to do their reductions which expands the list of legal traversals.
* `GroupStep` simplified with `GroupHelper.GroupMap` no longer being needed. Related to the removal of `FinalGet`.
* OLAP side-effects that are no longer generated by `MapReduce` are simply stored in `ComputerResult.Memory` w/ no disk persistence needed. *(breaking)*
* Added `Generate` step interface which states that there could be a final generating phase to a side-effect or reduction (e.g. `GroupStep`).
* `Barrier` step interface is now the means by which non-parallel steps communicate with their counterparts in OLAP.
* Added `MemoryComputing` step interface which states that the step uses `MemoryComputeKeys` for its computation in OLAP.
* Added `PeerPressureVertexProgramStep` and `GraphTraversal.peerPressure()`.
* Added `PureTraversal` for handling pure and compiled versions of a `Traversal`. Useful in OLAP.
* Added `ScriptTraversal` which allows for delayed compilation of script-based `Traversals`.
* Simplified `VertexProgram` implementations with a `PureTraversal`-model and deprecated `ConfigurationTraversal`.
* Simplified script-based `Traversals` via `ScriptTraversal` and deprecated `TraversalScriptFunction` and `TraversalScriptHelper`.
* Added `TimesModulating` interface which allows the `Step` to decide how a `times()`-modulation should be handled.
* Added `ByModulating` interface which allows the `Step` to decide how a `by()`-modulation should be handled. *(breaking)*
* Simplified the `by()`-modulation patterns of `OrderGlobalStep` and `OrderLocalStep`.
* Added `GraphComputerTest.shouldSupportPreExistingComputeKeys()` to ensure existing compute keys are "revived." *(breaking)*
* Added `GraphComputerTest.shouldSupportJobChaining()` to ensure OLAP jobs can be linearly chained. *(breaking)*
* Fixed a bug in both `SparkGraphComputer` and `GiraphGraphComputer` regarding source data access in job chains.
* Expanded job chaining test coverage for `GraphComputer` providers.
* Added `TraversalHelper.onGraphComputer(traversal)`.
* `MapReduce.map()` no longer has a default implementation. This method must be implemented. *(breaking)*
* `TraversalVertexProgram` can work without a `GraphStep` start.
* Added `PageRankVertexProgramStep` and `GraphTraversal.pageRank()`.
* Added `TraversalVertexProgramStep` to support OLAP traversal job chaining.
* Added `VertexProgramStrategy` which compiles multiple OLAP jobs into a single traversal.
* Simplified the comparator model in `OrderGlobalStep` and `OrderLocalStep`.
* Refactored `TraversalSource` model to allow fluent-method construction of `TraversalSources`.
* Deprecated the concept of a `TraversalSource.Builder`.
* Removed the concept of a `TraversalEngine`. All `Traversal` modulations are now mediated by `TraversalStrategies`. *(breaking)*
* Added `SideEffectStrategy` for registering sideEffects in a spawned `Traversal`.
* Added `SackStrategy` for registering a sack for a spawned `Traversal`.
* Added `RequirementsStrategy` and `RequirementsStep` for adding dynamic `TraverserRequirements` to a `Traversal`.
* Removed `EngineDependentStrategy`.
* Renamed step interface `EngineDependent` to `GraphComputing` with method `onGraphComputer()`. *(breaking)*
* Cleaned up various `TraversalStrategy` tests now that `TraversalEngine` no longer exists.
* Added `GraphFilter` to support filtering out vertices and edges that won't be touched by an OLAP job.
* Added `GraphComputer.vertices()` and `GraphComputer.edges()` for `GraphFilter` construction. *(breaking)*
* `SparkGraphComputer`, `GiraphGraphComputer`, and `TinkerGraphComputer` all support `GraphFilter`.
* Added `GraphComputerTest.shouldSupportGraphFilter()` which verifies all filtered graphs have the same topology.
* Added `GraphFilterAware` interface to `hadoop-gremlin/` which tells the OLAP engine that the `InputFormat` handles filtering.
* `GryoInputFormat` and `ScriptInputFormat` implement `GraphFilterAware`.
* Added `GraphFilterInputFormat` which handles graph filtering for `InputFormats` that are not `GraphFilterAware`.
* Fixed a bug in `TraversalHelper.isLocalStarGraph()` which allowed certain illegal traversals to pass.
* Added `TraversalHelper.isLocalProperties()` to verify that the traversal does not touch incident edges.
* `GraphReader` I/O interface now has `Optional<Vertex> readGraph(InputStream, GraphFilter)`. Default `UnsupportedOperationException`.
* `GryoReader` does not materialize edges that will be filtered out and this greatly reduces GC and load times.
* Created custom `Serializers` for `SparkGraphComputer` message-passing classes which reduce graph sizes significantly.

* Provided Docker script that allows the execution of several build tasks within a Docker container.
* Added a per-request `scriptEvaluationTimeout` option to the Gremlin Server protocol.
* Changed `DriverRemoteAcceptor` to send scripts as multi-line.
* Fixed a bug in `gremlin-driver` where connections were not returning to the pool after many consecutive errors.
* Fixed a bug where `tree()` did not serialize into GraphSON.
* Bumped to SLF4j 1.7.19.
* Bumped to Apache Hadoop 2.7.2.
* Fixed a bug in `gremlin-driver` where a really fast call to get a `Future` to wait for a result might not register an error raised from the server.
* Fixed a severe bug where `LP_O_OB_P_S_SE_SL_Traverser` was not registered with `GryoMapper`.
* The future from `GremlinExecutor.eval()` is completed after the entire evaluation lifecyle is completed.
* Spark `Memory` uses `collect().iterator()` instead of `toLocalIterator()` to reduce noise in Spark UI.
* Added the `:remote console` option which flips the Gremlin Console into a remote-only mode where all script evaluation is routed to the currently configured remote, which removes the need to use the `:>` command.
* Added `allowRemoteConsole()` to the `RemoteAcceptor` interface.
* The `:remote` for `tinkerpop.server` now includes an option to establish the connection as a "session".
* Provided an implementation for calls to `SessionedClient.alias()`, which formerly threw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
* Bumped to commons-collections 3.2.2.
* Fixed a bug where `OrderGlobalStep` and `OrderLocalStep` were not incorporating their children's traverser requirements.

* Added the `gremlin-archetype-tinkergraph` archetype that demonstrates a basic project that uses TinkerGraph.
* Added `gremlin-archetype` module to house TinkerPop "examples".
* Fixed a condition where `ConnectionPool` initialization in the driver would present a `NullPointerException` on initialization if there were errors constructing the pool in full.
* Fixed a bug in the round-robin load balancing strategy in the driver would waste requests potentially sending messages to dead hosts.
* Added new Provider Documentation book - content for this book was extracted from the reference documentation.
* Fixed a bug where multiple "close" requests were being sent by the driver on `Client.close()`.
* Fixed an `Property` attach bug that shows up in serialization-based `GraphComputer` implementations.

* Improved reusability of unique test directory creation in `/target` for `AbstractGraphProvider`, which was formerly only available to Neo4j, by adding `makeTestDirectory()`.
* Optimized memory-usage in `TraversalVertexProgram`.
* `Graph` instances are not merely "closed" at the end of tests, they are "cleared" via `GraphProvider.clear()`, which should in turn cleans up old data for an implementation.
* Expanded the Gremlin Server protocol to allow for transaction management on in-session requests and updated the `gremlin-driver` to take advantage of that.
* Greatly reduced the amount of objects required in OLAP for the `ReducingBarrierStep` steps.
* Improved messages for the different distinct "timeouts" that a user can encounter with Gremlin Server.

* Made `GryoRecordReader` more robust to 0 byte record splits.
* Fixed a constructor/serialization bug in `LP_O_OB_S_SE_SL_Traverser`.
* Added a lazy iterator, memory safe implementation of MapReduce to `SparkGraphComputer`.
* Added `MapReduce.combine()` support to `SparkGraphComputer`.
* Bumped to Neo4j 2.3.2.
* Fixed Java comparator contract issue around `Order.shuffle`.
* Optimized a very inefficient implementation of `SampleLocalStep`.
* Reduced the complexity and execution time of all `AbstractLambdaTraversal` instances.
* `DefaultTraversal` has a well defined `hashCode()` and `equals()`.
* Added serializers to Gryo for `java.time` related classes.
* Integrated `NumberHelper` in `SackFunctions`.
* Deprecated `VertexPropertyFeatures.supportsAddProperty()` which effectively was a duplicate of `VertexFeatures.supportsMetaProperties`.
* The Spark persistence `StorageLevel` can now be set for both job graphs and `PersistedOutputRDD` data.
* Added to the list of "invalid binding keys" allowed by Gremlin Server to cover the private fields of `T` which get exposed in the `ScriptEngine` on static imports.
* Added `BulkDumperVertexProgram` that allows to dump a whole graph in any of the supported IO formats (GraphSON, Gryo, Script).
* Fixed a bug around duration calculations of `cap()`-step during profiling.
* It is possible to completely avoid using HDFS with Spark if `PersistedInputRDD` and `PersistedOutpuRDD` are leveraged.
* `InputRDD` and `OutputRDD` can now process both graphs and memory (i.e. sideEffects).
* Removed Groovy specific meta-programming overloads for handling Hadoop `FileSystem` (instead, its all accessible via `FileSystemStorage`).
* Added `FileSystemStorage` and `SparkContextStorage` which both implement the new `Storage` API.
* Added `Storage` to the gremlin-core io-package which providers can implement to allow conventional access to data sources (e.g. `ls()`, `rm()`, `cp()`, etc.).
* Bumped to Spark 1.5.2.
* Bumped to Groovy 2.4.5.
* Added `--noClean` option in `bin/process-docs.sh` to prevent the script from cleaning Grapes and HDFS.
* Execute the `LifeCycle.beforeEval()` in the same thread that `eval()` is executed in for `GremlinExecutor`.
* Improved error handling of Gremlin Console initialization scripts to better separate errors in initialization script I/O versus execution of the script itself.
* Fixed a bug in `Graph.OptOut` when trying to opt-out of certain test cases with the `method` property set to "*".
* Added another `BulkLoader` implementation (`OneTimeBulkLoader`) that doesn't store temporary properties in the target graph.
* Added option to allow for a custom `ClassResolver` to be assigned to a `GryoMapper` instance.
* Fixed a `SparkGraphComputer` sorting bug in MapReduce that occurred when there was more than one partition.
* Added `strictTransactionManagement` to the Gremlin Server settings to indicate that the `aliases` parameter must be passed on requests and that transaction management will be scoped to the graphs provided in that argument.
* Fixed a `NullPointerException` bug in `PeerPressureVertexProgram` that occurred when an adjacency traversal was not provided.
* Standardized "test data directories" across all tests as generated by `TestHelper`.
* Fixed a bug in Gremlin Server where error messages were not always being passed back in the `statusMessage` field of the `ResponseMessage`.
* Added validation for parameter `bindings` to ensure that keys were `String` values.
* Improved Transaction Management consistency in Gremlin Server.
* Added `FileSandboxExtension` which takes a configuration file to white list methods and classes that can be used in `ScriptEngine` execution.
* Deprecated `SandboxExtension` and `SimpleSandboxExtension` in favor of `AbstractSandboxExtension` which provides better abstractions for those writing sandboxes.
* Fixed a long standing "view merge" issue requiring `reduceByKey()` on input data to Spark. It is no longer required.
* Added `Spark` static object to allow "file system" control of persisted RDDs in Spark.
* Added a Spark "job server" to ensure that persisted RDDs are not garbage collected by Spark.
* Improved logging control during builds with Maven.
* Fixed settings that weren't being passed to the Gremlin Driver `Cluster` through configuration file.
* `Column` now implements `Function`. The modulator `by(valueDecr)` can be replaced by `by(values,decr)` and thus, projection and order are separated.
* Added `InputRDDFormat` which wraps an `InputRDD` to make it accessible to Hadoop and not just Spark.
* Added `AbstractSparkTest` which handles closing `SparkContext` instances between tests now that we support persisted contexts.
* Fixed a serialization bug in `GryoSerializer` that made it difficult for graph providers to yield `InputRDDs` for `SparkGraphComputer`.
* `SparkGraphComputer` is now tested against Gryo, GraphSON, and `InputRDD` data sources.
* `HadoopElementIterator` (for Hadoop-Gremlin OLTP) now works for any `InputFormat`, not just `FileInputFormats`.
* Added `Traverser.Admin.getTags()` which are used to mark branches in a traversal (useful in `match()` and related future steps).
* Fixed the `Future` model for `GiraphGraphComputer` and `SparkGraphComputer` so that class loaders are preserved.
* Added support for arbitrary vertex ID types in `BulkLoaderVertexProgram`.
* Deprecated `credentialsDbLocation` from `SimpleAuthenticator` in Gremlin Server.
* `TinkerGraph` has "native" serialization in GraphSON, which enables it to be a return value from Gremlin Server.
* Improved the ability to embed Gremlin Server by providing a way to get the `ServerGremlinExecutor` and improve reusability of `AbstractEvalOpProcessor` and related classes.
* Added `Authenticator.newSaslNegotiator(InetAddress)` and deprecated the zero-arg version of that method.
* `ProfileStep` is now available off of `Traversal` via `profile()`. To be consistent with `Traversal.explain()`.
* If no comparator is provided to `order()`, `Order.incr` is assumed (previously, an exception occurred).
* Fixed various Gremlin-Groovy tests that assumed `toString()`-able ids.
* Split TinkerPop documentation into different directories.
* Added `explain()`-step which yields a `TraversalExplanation` with a pretty `toString()` detailing the compilation process.
* Fixed a traversal strategy ordering bug in `AdjacentToIncidentStrategy` and `IncidentToAdjacentStrategy`.
* Made a number of changes to improve traversal startup and execution performance.
* Added support for 'gremlin.tinkergraph.graphLocation' to accept a fully qualified class name that implements `Io.Builder` interface.

[[release-3-1-0-incubating]]
=== TinkerPop 3.1.0 (Release Date: November 16, 2015)

This release also includes changes from <<release-3-0-1-incubating, 3.0.1-incubating>> and <<release-3-0-2-incubating, 3.0.2-incubating>>.

* Fixed bug in Gryo and GraphSON (with embedded types) serialization for serialization of results returned from `Map.entrySet()`.
* `Transaction` settings for `onReadWrite` and `onClose` are now `ThreadLocal` in nature of standard transactions.
* Optimized `BulkLoaderVertexProgram`. It now uses `EventStrategy` to monitor what the underlying `BulkLoader` implementation does (e.g. whether it creates a new vertex or returns an existing).
* Integrated `NumberHelper` in `SumStep`, `MinStep`, `MaxStep` and `MeanStep` (local and global step variants).
* Gremlin Console remoting to Gremlin Server now supports a configuration option for assigning aliases.
* `CountMatchAlgorithm`, in OLAP, now biases traversal selection towards those traversals that start at the current traverser location to reduce message passing.
* Fixed a file stream bug in Hadoop OLTP that showed up if the streamed file was more than 2G of data.
* Added the ability to set thread local properties in `SparkGraphComputer` when using a persistent context.
* Bumped to Neo4j 2.3.0.
* Deprecated "rebindings" as an argument to Gremlin Server and replaced it with "aliases".
* Added `PersistedInputRDD` and `PersistedOutputRDD` which enables `SparkGraphComputer` to store the graph RDD in the context between jobs (no HDFS serialization required).
* Renamed the `public static String` configuration variable names of TinkerGraph (deprecated old variables).
* Added `GraphComputer.configure(key,value)` to allow engine-specific configurations.
* `GraphStep` is no longer in the `sideEffect`-package and is now in `map`-package (breaking change).
* Added support for mid-traversal `V()`-steps (`GraphStep` semantics updated).
* Fixed `Number` handling in `Operator` enums. Prior this change a lot of operations on mixed `Number` types returned a wrong result (wrong data type).
* Fixed a bug in Gremlin Server/Driver serializer where empty buffers were getting returned in certain cases.
* Renamed `ConjunctionX` to `ConnectiveX` because "conjunction" is assumed "and" (disjunction "or"), where "connective" is the parent concept.
* Removed `PathIdentityStep` as it was a hack that is now solved by `Traversal.Admin.addTraverserRequirement()`.
* Added `Traversal.Admin.addTraverserRequirement()` to allow a traversal strategy or source to add requirements (not only step determined anymore).
* Added `TraverserRequirement.ONE_BULK` to state the traverser does not handle bulk.
* Added `GraphTraversalSource.withBulk(boolean)` to enabled users to compute only using `bulk=1`.
* Gremlin Server supports Netty native transport on linux.
* Removed the need for `GFunction` (etc.) closure wrappers in Gremlin-Groovy as `as Function` can be used to convert closures accordingly.
* Added `SelectColumnStep` (`select(keys)` and `select(values)`). Deprecated `mapKeys()` and `mapValues()`.
* Renamed `gremlin.hadoop.graphInputRDD` and `gremlin.hadoop.graphOutputRDD` to `gremlin.spark.graphInputRDD` and `gremlin.spark.graphOutputRDD`, respectively.
* Fixed a bug in `FoldStep` around bulking. This could be a breaking change, but it is the correct semantics.
* Previous `group()`-behavior steps are accessible via the deprecated `groupV3d0()`-steps.
* `GroupStep` and `GroupSideEffectStep` now do lazy reductions to reduce memory footprint. Breaking change for `group()` semantics.
* Added `GroupStepHelper` with various static methods and classes that are used by both `GroupStep` and `GroupSideEffectStep`.
* Added `BarrierStep` interface with `processAllStarts()` method which process all starts up to yielding the barrier result.
* Fixed a severe threading issue in `TinkerGraphComputer`.
* The location of the jars in HDFS is now `hadoop-gremlin-x.y.z-libs` to ensure multiple TinkerPop versions don't clash.
* `GiraphGraphComputer` will only upload the jars to HDFS if it doesn't already exist (to help speed up startup time).
* `GiraphGraphComputer.workers()` is smart about using threads and machines to load balance TinkerPop workers across cluster.
* `GraphComputer.workers(int)` allows the user to programmatically set the number of workers to spawn.
* Added `GryoSerializer` as the new recommended Spark `Serializer`. Handles `Graph` and `GryoMapper` registries.
* `GryoPool` now makes use of `GryoPool.Builder` for its construction.
* Bumped to Apache Hadoop 2.7.1.
* Bumped to Apache Giraph 1.1.0.
* Bumped to Apache Spark 1.5.1.
* Split Hadoop-Gremlin apart such there is now `hadoop-gremlin`, `spark-gremlin`, and `giraph-gremlin` (and respective `GremlinPlugins`).
* Added `LambdaCollectingBarrierStep` which generalizes `NoOpBarrierStep` and allows for `barrier(normSack)`-type operations.
* Fixed bugs in the Gremlin Server's NIO protocol both on the server and driver side.
* Added `Path.popEquals(Pop,Object)` to check for path equality based on `Pop` (useful for `TraverserRequirement.LABELED_PATH`).
* Added `Operator.assign` to allow setting a direct value.
* `Operator` is now a `BinaryOperator<Object>` with appropriate typecasting for respective number operators.
* Simplified `SackValueStep` so it now supports both `sack(function)` and `sack(function).by()`. Deprecated `sack(function,string)` .
* Added `Parameters` object to allow for the parameters of a step to be retrieved at runtime via a traversal.
* Redesigned (though backwards compatible) `AddEdgeStep`, `AddVertexStep`, and `AddPropertyStep` (and respective `GraphTraversal` API).
* Added `GraphTraversalSource.inject()` so users can spawn a traverser with non-graph objects.
* `GraphStep` can now take a single argument `Collection` which is either elements or element ids (i.e. `g.V([1,2,3])` is supported now).
* Added `LoopsStep` to make the loop counter accessible within `repeat()`, `until()` and `emit()`.
* Gephi Plugin no longer requires manual insert of `store` steps to visualize a traversal.
* Added a `TinkerIoRegistry` that registers a custom serializer for Gryo that will serialize an entire `TinkerGraph` instance.
* Added configuration options to Gephi Plugin for setting the size of nodes visualized.
* Replaced `DedupBijectionStrategy` with the more effective `FilterRankingStrategy`.
* `ComputerAwareSteps` must not only handle step ids, but also step labels.
* Renamed `B_O_P_SE_SL_Traverser` to `B_LP_O_P_SE_SL_Traverser` as it now supports `TraverserRequirement.LABELED_PATH`.
* Added `B_LP_O_S_SE_SL_Traverser` in support of `TraverserRequirement.LABELED_PATH`.
* Added `TraverserRequirement.LABELED_PATH` which only generates path data for steps that are labeled (greatly increases the likelihood of bulking).
* Fixed a bug in `Path` usage that required an API update: `Path.addLabel()` is now `Path.extend(Set<String>)` and `Traverser.addLabels(Set<String>)`.
* Made `Path` iterable, so that it can be ``unfold()``'ed and used by local steps like `min(local)`, `max(local)`, etc.
* `WhereTraversalStep` and `WherePredicateStep` are now the only "special" `Scoping` steps after `MatchStartStep` in `match()`.

==== Bugs

* TINKERPOP-774 order / dedup issues

* Introduced `GraphProvider.Descriptor` which annotates a `GraphProvider` implementation to describe what `GraphComputer` implementation will be used.
* Modified `OptOut` to include a `computers` attribute which allows the `Graph` to opt-out of computer-based tests for specific computation engines.
* Added a `SandboxExtension` that can be plugged into `TypeCheckedCustomizerProvider` and `CompileStaticCustomizerProvider` to control classes and methods that can be used in the `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine`.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0 (Release Date: July 9, 2015)

* Modified the `GremlinExecutor` to catch `Throwable` as opposed to `Exception` so as to properly handle `Error` based exceptions.
* Modified the `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine` compilation configuration to prevent inappropriate script evaluation timeouts on standalone functions.
* Added a custom configuration for "timed interrupt" in the `ScriptEngines` instantiation of the `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine`.
* Added `mapKeys()` (`MapKeyStep`) and `mapValues()` (`MapValueStep`) to get the keys and values of a map, respectively.
* `select()` no longer supports empty arguments. The user must specify the keys they are selecting.
* `MatchStep` and `match()` no longer have a "start label" parameter -- it is computed if the incoming traverser does not have requisite labels.
* Turned transactional testing back on in Gremlin Server using Neo4j.
* Renamed `Transaction.create()` to `Transaction.createThreadedTx()`.
* Added `TraversalParent.removeGlobalChild()` and `TraversalParent.removeLocalChild()`.
* Added a `clear` option to the Gephi Plugin to empty the Gephi workspace.
* Refactored `ResultSet` and related classes to stop polling for results.
* `AbstractStep` now guarantees that bulk-less and null-valued traversers are never propagated.
* Added `dedup(string...)` which allows for the deduplication of a stream based on unique scope values.
* Fixed multiple bugs in the Gephi Plugin related to refactoring of traversal side-effects.
* Split `WhereStep` into `WherePredicateStep` and `WhereTraversalStep` to simplify internals.
* Prevent the driver from attempting to reconnect on a dead host if the `Cluster.close()` method has been called.
* Renamed the "deactivate" option on `:plugin` command to "unuse" to be symmetric with the "use" option.
* Added `Traversal.toStream()` to turn the `Traversal<S,E>` into a `Stream<E>`.
* Added `Scoping.Variable` enum of `START` and `END` which allows the `Scoping` step to specify where its bindings are.
* `ComputerVerificationStrategy` is smart about not allowing `WhereXXXStep` with a start-variable to run in OLAP as it selects the value from the path.
* Rewrote `MatchStep` where it now works on `GraphComputer`, solves more patterns, provides plugable execution plans, supports nested AND/OR, `not()`-patterns, etc.
* Renamed `Graphs` in Gremlin Server to `GraphManager`.
* Fixed bug in Gremlin Driver where client-side serialization errors would not bubble up properly.
* Fixed problem in Gremlin Server to ensure that a final `SUCCESS` or `NO_CONTENT` message assured that the transaction was successful in sessionless requests.
* Arrow keys for cycling through command history now work in Gremlin Console when being used on Windows.
* Added `NotStep` and `not(traversal)` for not'ing a traversal (integrates like `ConjunctionStep`).
* Removed `TraversalP`. Traversals and `P`-predicates are completely separate concepts.
* `has(key,traversal)` is now an alias for `filter(__.values(key).traversal)` using `TraversalFilterStep`.
* Simplified `SubgraphStrategy` by using `TraversalFilterStep` instead of the more complex `WhereStep`.
* Added `TraversalMapStep`, `TraversalFlatMapStep`, `TraversalFilterStep`, and `TraversalSideEffectStep` which all leverage an internal traversal.
* Added `Path.get(pop,label)` as default helpers in `Path`.
* Added `Pop.first`, `Pop.last`, and `Pop.all` as enums for getting single items from a collection or a list of said items.
* Changed `GremlinServer.start()` to return a `CompletableFuture` that contains the constructed `ServerGremlinExecutor`.
* Restructured `IoTest` breaking it up into smaller and more logically grouped test cases.
* Gremlin Server `Settings` now has sensible defaults thus allowing the server to be started with no additional configuration.
* Fixed garbled characters in Gremlin Console that notably showed up in `:help`
* Replaced dependency on `groovy-all` with individual Groovy dependencies as needed.
* Bumped `org.gperfutils:gbench` to the `0.4.3` and a version explicitly compatible with Groovy 2.4.x.
* Renamed `KeyStep` to `PropertyKeyStep` to be consistent with `PropertyValueStep`.
* Added `Gremlin-Lib-Paths` to modify paths in plugin `lib` directory.
* Modified the capabilities of `Gremlin-Plugin-Paths` to delete paths that have no value on the right-hand-side of the equals sign.
* The REST API in Gremlin Server now requires parameters to be defined with a "bindings." prefix.
* Modified the REST API in Gremlin Server to accept rebindings.
* Added `rebindings` optional argument to sessionless requests to allow global bindings to be rebound as needed.

* `Scoping` now has `getScopeKeys()` to get the keys desired by the scoping step.
* Refactored SSL support in the Gremlin Server/Driver.
* Factored out `ServerGremlinExecutor` which contains the core elements of server-side script execution in Gremlin Server.
* Bumped to netty 4.0.28.Final.
* Refactored the `Mutating` interface and introduce `CallbackRegistry` interface around `EventStrategy`.
* Changed `onReadWrite` and `onClose` of `AbstractTransaction` to be synchronized.

* Added `willAllowId` method to features related to vertices, edges and vertex properties to test if an identifier can be use when `supportsUserSuppliedIds` is `true`.
* Fixed a bug in `GraphTraversal.choose(predicate,trueTraversal,falseTraversal)`.
* Removed `MapTraversal`, `MapTraverserTraversal`, `FilterTraversal`, and `FilterTraverserTraversal` as these are simply `__.map(function)` and `__.filter(predicate)`.
* Include `hadoop-gremlin` Hadoop configuration sample files in Gremlin Console distribution.
* Iteration of results in Gremlin Server occur in the same thread as evaluation and prior to transaction close.
* TinkerGraphComputer now supports every `ResultGraph`/`Persist` combination.
* `GraphComputerTest` extended with validation of the semantics of all `ResultGraph`/`Persist` combinations.
* GiraphGraphComputer no longer requires an extra iteration and MapReduce job to derive the full `Memory` result.
* SparkGraphComputer now supports `InputRDD` and `OutputRDD` to allow vendors/users to use a `SparkContext` to read/write the graph adjacency list.
* Added `Scoping.getScopeValue()` method so all "selecting" steps use the same pattern for map, path, and sideEffect data retrieval.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M9 (Release Date: May 26, 2015)

* Removed `GraphComputer.isolation()` as all implementations use standard BSP.
* Added a Gremlin Server `LifeCycleHook` to ensure that certain scripts execute once at startup and once at shutdown.
* `has(key)` and `hasNot(key)` are now aliases for `where(values(key))` and `where(not(values(key)))`, respectively.
* TinkerGraph classes are now final to restrict user and vendor extension.
* Added `TraversalStrategy.VendorOptimization` to ensure that all TinkerPop optimizations execute first on the known TinkerPop steps.
* Added `TailGlobalStep` and `TailLocalStep` (`tail()`) which gets objects from the end of the traversal stream.
* `AndStep` and `OrStep` are now simply markers where `WhereStep(a.and(b).and(c)...and(z))` is the compilation.
* Moved `Compare`, `Contains`, `Order`, `Operator`, and `P` to `process/traversal` from `structure/` as they are process-based objects.
* `HasContainer` now uses `P` predicate as helper methods and tests are more thorough on `P`.
* Changed Gremlin Server integration/performance tests to be runnable from within the `gremlin-server` directory or from the project root.
* Moved the string methods of `TraversalHelper` to `StringFactory`.
* Renamed JSON-related serializers for Gremlin Server to be more consistent with GraphSON naming.
* Removed `HasTraversalStep` in favor of new `P.traversal` model with `HasStep`.
* Fixed bug in `WsGremlinTextRequestDecoder` where custom serializers from graphs were not being used.
* Added `AndP` which allows for the `and()`-ing of `P` predicates.
* `Order.opposite()` is now `reversed()` as that is a `Comparator` interface method with the same semantics.
* `Compare/Contains/P.opposite()` are now `negate()` as that is a `BiPredicate` interface method with the same semantics.
* `has(traversal)` is replaced by `where(traversal)` and `has(key,traversal)`. `HasXXX` is always with respects to an element property.
* Added `TraversalScriptHelper` with static methods for dynamically creating a `Traversal` from a JSR 223 `ScriptEngine`.
* Changed `SubgraphStrategy` to take `Traversal` rather than `Predicate` for filtering.
* Improved `SubgraphStrategy` to only modify the `Traversal` if filtering was required.
* Improved logging of errors in the `HttpGremlinEndpointHandler` to include a stracktrace if one was present.
* Moved `AbstractGremlinSuite.GraphProviderClass` to `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.GraphProviderClass`.
* Simplified the Gremlin-Groovy test suite where there is now no distinction between `STANDARD` and `COMPUTER` tests.
* `VertexProgram` and `MapReduce` now add a `Graph` parameter to `loadState(Graph, Configuration)`.
* Added `ScopingStrategy` which auto-scopes `select()` and `where()` so the language looks clean.
* Added `Scoping` as a marker interface to state that a step desires a particular `Scope`.
* `SelectStep`, `SelectOneStep`, and `WhereStep` support both `Scope.local` and `Scope.global` for `Map<String,Object>` or `Path` analysis, respectively.
* Fixed a bug in the `TraversalStrategies` sort algorithm.
* Removed numerous unused static utility methods in `TraversalHelper`.
* TinkerGraph process suite tests are now running with and without strategies in place.
* Added `IncidentToAdjacentStrategy` which rewrites `outE().inV()`, `inE().outV()` and `bothE().otherV()` to `out()`, `in()` and `both()` respectively.
* Renamed `ComparatorHolderRemovalStrategy` to `OrderGlobalRemovalStrategy` as it now only applies to `OrderGlobalStep`.
* Anonymous traversal no longer have `EmptyGraph` as their graph, but instead use `Optional<Graph>.isPresent() == false`.
* Added `Traversal.Admin.setGraph(Graph)` as strategies that need reference to the graph, need it across all nested traversals.
* `AbstractLambdaTraversal` is now smart about `TraversalParent` and `TraversalStrategies`.
* Fixed bug in `GraphML` reader that was not allowing `<edge>` elements to come before `<node>` elements as allowable by the GraphML specification.
* Added `VertexFeature.getCardinality`.
* Added `AdjacentToIncidentStrategy` which rewrites `out().count()` to `outE().count()` (and similar such patterns).
* `GryoPool` now takes a `Configuration` object which allows setting the size of the pool and the `IoRegistry` instance.
* Added `PersistResultGraphAware` interface which is used by `OutputFormats` to specify persistence possibilities for a Hadoop `GraphComputer`.
* `ElementIdStrategy` now allows the identifier property to be set directly (and not only by specifying `T.id`).
* Added sample configuration files for registering a `TraversalStrategy` in Gremlin Server.
* Added response status code for `NO_CONTENT` to represent output for a successful script execution without a result (e.g. an empty `Iterator`).
* Removed the notion of a "terminator" message from the Gremlin Server protocol - new response status code for `PARTIAL_CONTENT`.
* `Path` and `Step` labels are ordered by the order in which the respective `addLabel()` calls were made.
* A `Step` now has a `Set<String>` of labels. Updated `as()` to take a var args of labels.
* Dropped `BatchGraph` from the code base - it will be replaced by bulk loader functionality over OLAP.
* `TraversalSideEffects` now implements `Optional` semantics. Less code as Java8 provides the helper methods.
* `TraversalScriptSupplier` now takes an `Object` var args for setting `ScriptEngine` bindings if needed.
* `Compare` is now more lenient on `Number`-types.
* Removed `Compare.inside` and `Compare.outside` as they are not primitive comparators and should be composed from primitives.
* Introduced `P` (predicate) for cleaner looking `is()`, `has()`, and `where()` calls -- e.g. `has('age',eq(32))`.
* `GraphTraversalSource` is now the location for `withXXX()` operations. No longer do they exist at `GraphTraversal`.
* All `Traverser` objects now extend from `AbstractTraverser` or a child that ultimately extends from `AbstractTraverser`.
* OLTP `select()` now returns a list for traversals with duplicate labels (as this was a unintended side-effect of `SparsePath`).
* Removed the `SparsePath` optimization as it led to numerous corner-case inconsistencies.
* `VertexWritable` serializes and deserializes the `StarGraph` object -- no more intermediate `DetachedXXX` objects.
* Gremlin Server better supports the settings for the high and low watermark that will slow writes to clients that are lagging.
* Added `GraphReader.readObject()` and `GraphWriter.writeObject` abstractions for those implementations that can support them.
* Altered `GraphWriter.writeVertices()` method to take an `Iterator` of vertices rather than a `Traversal`.
* GraphSON format for output from `GraphWriter.writeVertex`, `GraphWriter.writeVertices`, and `GraphWriter.writeGraph` have all changed now that they use `StarGraph` serialization.
* Gryo format for output from `GraphWriter.writeVertex`, `GraphWriter.writeVertices`, and `GraphWriter.writeGraph` have all changed now that they use `StarGraph` serialization.
* Added read and write methods to `GraphReader` and `GraphWriter` for `Property` and `VertexProperty`.
* Reduced object creation in GraphSON during serialization.
* Moved `T` tokens to the `structure/` package as its more general than `process/`.
* `Attachable.attach()` now takes a `Method` to determine whether to attach via `GET`, `CREATE`, or `GET_OR_CREATE`.
* Decreased size of Gremlin Server `RequestMessage` and `ResponseMessage` serialization payloads and reduced object creation.
* `Graph.empty()` no longer required with the introduction of `ShellGraph` which is a placeholder for a graph class and computer.
* `VertexProperty.Cardinality` default is now vendor chosen. If the vendor has not preference, they should use `Cardinality.single`.
* `Messenger.receiveMessages()` no longer takes a `MessageScope` and thus, consistent behavior between message-passing and message-pulling systems.
* Changed the `gremlin.tests` environment variable for test filtering to the more standard convention of `GREMLIN_TESTS` and made it work for all test suites.
* Removed `back()`-step as `select()`-step provides the same behavior with more intelligent optimizations and `by()`-modulation.
* Removed `Graph.Helper` method annotation and related infrastructure in tests.
* Modified header of Gryo to be 16 bytes instead of 32 (and removed the version stamp).
* Removed the concept of handling version in Gryo via the builder as it wasn't really accomplishing the capability of ensuring backward compatibility.
* Moved `Exceptions.propertyRemovalNotSupported` from `Element` to `Property` for consistency.
* Provided a method for Gremlin Server to bind `TraversalSource` objects for use in scripts.
* Modified the reference implementation for dealing with "custom" identifier serialization in GraphSON - See `IoTest.CustomId` for the example.
* Modified `g.vertices/edges` and related methods and tests to support non-type specific querying (e.g. `g.V(1)` and `g.V(1L)` should both return the same result now).
* `TinkerGraph` supports an `IdManager` which helps enforce identifier types and improve flexibility in terms of how it will respond to queries around identifiers.
* `DetachedXXX` now uses the standard `structure/` exceptions for unsupported operations.
* Added private constructors to all `Exceptions` inner classes in the respective `structure/` interfaces.
* Re-introduced `ReferenceXXX` to ensure a smaller data footprint in OLAP situation (`DetachedXXX` uses too much data).
* `Attachable` now has a set of static exception messages in an `Exceptions` inner class.
* Added `StarGraph` which is a heap efficient representation of a vertex and its incident edges (useful for `GraphComputer` implementations).
* `TraverserSet` uses a `FastNoSuchElementException` on `remove()` for increased performance.
* Add `Profiling` interface to enable vendors to receive a `Step's MutableMetrics`.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M8 (Release Date: April 6, 2015)

* Removed Neo4j-Gremlin from this distribution due to GPL licensing. Working with Neo4j team to reintroduce by M9.
* Altered structure of plugin directories for Gremlin Server and Gremlin Console to allow for the full `lib` directory with all dependencies and the lighter `plugin` directory which contains filtered dependencies given the path.
* Improved `OptOut` to allow for exclusion of a group of tests by specifying a base test class.
* `GraphComputerTest` is now Java8 specific and much easier to extend with new test cases.
* Merged the `gremlin-algorithm` module into `gremlin-test`.
* Removed `LambdaVertexProgram` and `LambdaMapReduce` as it will be one less thing to maintain.
* Gremlin Console accepts a `max-iteration` configuration via the standard `:set` command to limit result iteration.
* `Vertex.property()` default behavior is now `Cardinality.single`.

* Added methods to registered transaction completion listeners on `Transaction` and provided a default implementation.
* Fixed bug in Neo4j where return of an empty meta property was returning a `NullPointerException`.
* Refactored step API -- the TinkerPop3 steps are the foundation for any domain specific language (including graph).
* `MapReduce` now has `workerStart(Stage)` and `workerEnd(Stage)` methods with analagous semantics to `VertexProgram`.
* Hadoop-Gremlin `ObjectWritable` now leverages Kryo for data serialization.

* Added `VertexProgramPool` to support thread safe pooling of vertex programs for graph computers that provide threaded workers.
* Added `GryoPool` to support thread safe pooling of Gryo readers and writers.
* Added `TraversalSource` which contextualizes a traversal to a graph, DSL, execution engine, and runtime strategies.
* Added `AddVertexStep` (`addV`), `AddPropertyStep` (`property`), and changed `AddEdgeStep` to a map-step instead of a sideEffect-step.
* Added `compile` method to `GremlinExecutor` and related classes.
* Fixed bug in Gremlin Server that was generating extra response messages on script evaluation errors.
* Changed the `Memory` API to not return the mutated value on `or`, `and`, `incr` as it is too difficult to implement faithfully in a distributed system.
* Added `SparkGraphComputer` to Hadoop-Gremlin which uses Apache Spark as the underlying computing engine.
* Renamed "Gremlin Kryo" to "Gryo".
* Refactored `TinkerWorkerPool` to use `ExecutorService` so as to reuse threads when executing graph computer functions.
* Removed `Reducing.Reducer` and `ReducingStrategy`. Previous `Reducing` classes are now `MapReducer` classes.
* Refactored the "process" test suite to allow for better test configuration with respect to different `TraversalEngine` implementations.
* Added `hasNot(traversal)` which is a faster way of doing `has(traversal.count().is(0L))`.
* `TraversalStrategy.apply(traversal)` is the new method signature as the `TraversalEngine` can be retrieved from the `Traversal`.
* `TraversalEngine` is now an interface and provided to the traversal by the graph. `Graph` methods added to set the desired traversal engine to use.
* Added `count(local)`, `sum(local)`, `max(local)`, `min(local)`, `mean(local)`, `dedup(local)`, `sample(local)` and `range(local)` for operating on the local object (e.g. collection, map, etc.).
* `TraversalComparator` exists which allows for `order().by(outE().count(),decr)`.
* Added Apache Rat plugin to detect the proper inclusion of license headers in files.
* A `Traversal` now respects thread interruption during iteration, throwing a `TraversalInterruptionException` if it encounters interruption on the current thread.
* Apache refactoring: `com.tinkerpop` -> `org.apache.tinkerpop`.
* `Traversal` is now `Serializable` and with most queries no longer needing lambdas, Gremlin-Java works over the wire.
* Added `VertexProperty.Cardinality` with `list`, `set`, and `single`. No more `Vertex.singleProperty()` method.
* Added `RangeByIsCountStrategy` that adds a `RangeStep` in front of `.count().is(<predicate>, <value>)` to minimize the amount of fetched elements.
* Added `CoalesceStep` / `coalesce()` that emits the first traversal which emits at least one element.
* Added more syntactic sugar tricks to the Gremlin sugar plugin -- `&`, `|`, `select from`, `gt`, etc.

* `TraversalHolder` is now called `TraversalParent` with the child/parent terminology used throughout.
* Added `GroovyEnvironmentPerformanceSuite`.
* Provided more robust shutdown capabilities for the thread pools used in `GremlinExecutor`.

* Bumped to Groovy 2.4.1.
* Added a new "performance" test suite for Gremlin Process.
* Steps now only operate with traversals -- no more lambdas. Lambda-> `Traversal` conversion utilities added.

* Changed the `OptOut` annotation to allow for ignoring an entire test case using a wildcard.
* Added `AndStep` and `OrStep` filters to support arbitrary conjunction of traversals.
* `__` is now a class with static `GraphTraversal` methods and thus `repeat(out())` is possible.
* Added `IsStep` / `.is()` that supports filtering scalar values.
* `Neo4jGraph` and `TinkerGraph` no longer create new `Feature` instances on each feature check.
* Added `Compare.inside` and `Compare.outside` for testing ranges. Removed `between()` as now its `has('age',inside,[10,30])`.
* `GraphTraversal.has()` no longer requires the element type to be cast in the traversal definition.
* Fixed a `ConcurrentModificationException` bug in TinkerGraph that occurred when doing full vertex/edge scans and removing elements along the way.
* Added `Scope.local` and `Scope.global` in support of `OrderLocalStep` and `OrderGlobalStep` via `order(scope)`.
* Added `Order.keyIncr`, `Order.keyDecr`, `Order.valueIncr`, and `Order.valueDecr` in support of `Map` sorting.
* Added `Order.shuffle` and removed `shuffle()` in favor of `order().by(shuffle)`.
* Changed `Order implements Comparator<Comparable>` to `Order implements Comparator<Object>` as its now generalized to multiple types of objects.

* Fixed resource leak in the HTTP/REST Gremlin endpoint of Gremlin Server.
* Refactored Gremlin Server `start` and `stop` functions to return `CompletableFuture`.
* HTTP REST error response JSON objects from Gremlin Server should no longer have issues with control characters, line feeds, etc.
* Added `MeanStep`, `mean()`, and `MeanNumber` for calculating number averages in a traversal.
* Greatly simplified all the traversal `MapReduce` implementations due to the introduction of `VertexTraversalSideEffects`.
* Added `VertexTraversalSideEffects` as a cheap, static way to get a sideEffect-view of a vertex in OLAP.

* `Traversal.equals()` is no longer computed by determining if the objects returned are equal.
* Altered messaging in Gremlin Console when using a remote that is not yet activated.
* Fixed potential for deadlock in Gremlin Driver when waiting for results from the server.
* Added the `useMapperFromGraph` serializer option to the Gremlin Server configuration file to allow auto-registration of serialization classes.
* Refactored Netty pipeline structure to not have a second "Gremlin" executor group and instead used a standard `ExecutorService`.
* Refactored the `GremlinExecutor` to take an optional transformation function so as to allow manipulation of results from `eval` in the same thread of execution.
* Fixed issue with the `HttpGremlinEndpointHandler` where requests were getting blocked when `keep-alive` was on.
* Added `MinStep` and `MaxStep` with respective `min()` and `max()`.
* `CountStep` and `SumStep` now extend `ReducingBarrierStep` and no longer are sideEffect steps.
* `SideEffectCapStep` now extends `SupplyingBarrier` and is much simpler than before.
* Added `SupplyingBarrier` which simply drains the traversal and emits the value of a provided supplier.
* Added `TraversalLambda` which implements function, predicate, and consumer over a provided traversal.
* Any non-core `Step` that takes a function or predicate can now take a traversal which maps to `traversal.next()` (function) and `traversal.hasNext()` (predicate).
* `CollectingBarrierStep` is no longer abstract and added `GraphTraversal.barrier()` which is analogous to `fold().unfold()`, though cheaper.
* Added `TraversalOptionHolder` for branching steps to index works with corresponding `GraphTraversal.option()`.
* `BranchStep` is now a proper generalization of `UnionStep` and `ChooseStep`.
* `SubgraphStep` has changed in support of in-traversal filtering and removing the need for path-based traversers.
* Added `HasTraversalStep` which takes an anonymous traversal to determine whether or not to filter the current object.
* Added `Traversal.Admin.getStartStep()` and `Traversal.Admin.getEndStep()`. Removed `TraversalHelper.getStart()` and `TraversalHelper.getEnd()`.
* Refactored `profile()` to use injected steps. `ProfileStep` can now be used without any special JVM command line parameters.
* Added `ReducingBarrierStep` which acts like `CollectingBarrierStep` but operates on a seed with a bi-function.
* Added a preprocessor for AsciiDocs. Documentation code examples are executed and the results are dynamically inserted into the doc file.
* `LocalStep` traversal is treated as a branch, not an isolated traversal. Moreover, moved `LocalStep` to `branch/`.
* Traversal strategies are now applied when the `TraversalVertexProgram` state is loaded, not when submitted. Less error prone as it guarantees strategy application.
* Reworked `TraversalHolder` where there are "local traversals" and "global traversals". Local traversals are not subject to OLAP message passing.
* Fixed a bug in `DedupStep` that made itself apparent in `DedupOptimizerStrategy`.
* Added `RepeatStep.RepeatEndStep` in order to reduce the complexity of the code on OLAP when the predicates are not at the start of `RepeatStep`.

* Added `SideEffectRegistrar` interface and `SideEffectRegistrationStrategy` for allowing steps to register sideEffects at strategy application time.
* Renamed `Traverser.Admin.setFuture()` and `Traverser.Admin.getFuture()` to `setStepId()` and `getStepId()`, respectively.
* Added `TraversalMatrix` for random access to steps in a traversal by their step id. Used by `TraversalVertexProgram`.
* Added unique identifies to `Step` that are not the user provided labels. `Step.getLabel()` now returns an `Optional<String>`.
* Removed `UnionLinearStrategy`, `ChooseLinearStrategy`, and `RepeatLinearStrategy` as nested traversals are now natively supported in OLAP.
* Fixed `Neo4jGraph` around manual transaction behavior on `commit` and `rollback` such that they would throw exceptions if a transaction was not open.
* Redesigned the hidden step labeling mechanism so its consistent across a cluster, easier for rewrite strategies, and will enable nested OLAP traversals.
* `Traverser.incrLoops()` now takes a string step label to enable nested looping constructs (i.e. loop stacks).
* Added `Traversal.tryNext()` which returns an `Optional`, where the provided default method should be sufficient for all vendors.
* Removed `PathConsumer` in favor of `TraverserRequirement.PATH`-model via `Step.getRequirements()`.
* `Step.getRequirements()` returns a `Set<TraverserRequirement>` which is what is required of the `Traverser` by the `Step`.
* `Traverser` now extends `Cloneable` and `Traverser.clone()` is used to good effect in `Traverser.split()`.
* Added `AbstractTraverser` for which all traversers extend.
* Moved `Traversal.SideEffects` to `TraversalSideEffects` as sideEffects are not necessarily tied to the traversal.
* Removed `Graph.of()` for generating anonymous graph traversals -- replaced by `__`-model.
* Removed `Graph` being stored in `Traversal.SideEffects`. Too dangerous when moving between OLTP and OLAP and its limited uses were worked around easily.
* No need for `DefaultXXXGraphTraversal` unless the vendor is extending with new methods (e.g. `DefaultNeo4jGraphTraversal`).
* Reworked `TraversalStrategies` such that the are "emanating object class"-dependant, not `Traversal` dependent.
* Moved `Traverser.sideEffects()` to `Traverser.asAdmin().getSideEffects()`. Users should use `Traverser.sideEffects(key)` and `Traverser.sideEffects(key,value)`.
* Added `SerializationTest` to the `StructureStandardSuite` in `gremlin-test` which validates serialization at a lower level than `IoTest`.
* Removed `IntervalStep` and renamed `interval()` to `between()` which is simply an alias to a `has().has()` chain.
* Added `__` static interface which allows for `__.out().out()`-style construction of anonymous traversals (instead of `g.of()`).
* The only `GraphTraversal` steps that operate on `Traverser` are the base lambdas and `repeat()` (i.e. `emit()` and `until()`).
* Removed dependency on the `reflections` library in `gremlin-test` which removed the default implementation of `GraphProvider.getImplementations()` - vendors now need to implement this method themselves.
* Relaxed the `<S>` typing requirement for anonymous traversals when applied to `choose()`, `repeat()`, `union()`, etc.
* Removed `LoopStep` and `UntilStep` in favor of the new `RepeatStep` model of looping in Gremlin3.
* `BranchStep` is now exposed in `GraphTraversal` via `branch(function)`.
* `UnionStep` now implements `TraversalHolder`.
* Added `RepeatStep` as the new looping construct supporting do/while, while/do, and emit semantics.
* Moved `Traversal.sideEffects()` to `Traversal.Admin.getSideEffects()` as `cap()` should be used to access the sideEffect data of a traversal.
* Renamed vendor `XXXTraversal` to `XXXGraphTraversal` (interface) and `XXXGraphTraversal` to `DefaultXXXGraphTraversal` (implementation class).
* Modified packaging for console plugins to be more consistent by moving them to the `com.tinkerpop.gremlin.console.groovy.plugin` namespace.
* Removed all TinkerPop specific dependencies to Guava to avoid user version conflicts.
* Added support for `-e` (script file execution) and `-v` (version display) options on `gremlin.sh`.
* GraphSON supports the assignment of multiple custom serialization modules.
* `Traverser.get(stepLabel/sideEffectKey)` no longer exists. There now exists: `Traverser.path(stepLabel)` and `Traverser.sideEffects(sideEffectKey)`.
* `SimpleTraverser` now supports "path" but in a very loose, global cache way. Added `SparsePath` as a `Map`-backed `Path` implementation.
* Provided Neo4j multi-label support in Neo4j-Gremlin. Added three `Neo4jVertex`-specific methods: `addLabel()`, `removeLabel()`, `labels()`.
* Bumped to Groovy 2.3.9.
* Added `Graph.Io` interface which allows for simplified helper methods for end users and a way for vendors to override `GraphReader` and `GraphWriter` initial construction when custom serializers are needed.
* Removed methods from `GraphProvider` related to customizing serializers in `IoTest` from the test suite as the new `Graph.Io` interface now serves that purpose.
* Added `Neo4jGraph.checkElementsInTransaction(boolean)` which will (or not) verify whether elements retrieved via Neo4j global graph operations are transactionally consistent.
* Added `ScriptInputFormat` and `ScriptOutputFormat` to Hadoop-Gremlin for reading and writing a file according to an arbitrary parsing script.
* Added `TimeLimitStep.getTimedOut()` to determine if the step timed out or there were no more objects to process.
* `Graph.System` is now `Graph.Hidden` with "hidden" being the vendor namespace and the key prefix being `~`.
* Much better `toString()` handling in `Step` and `Traversal`.
* `ComparatorHolder<V>` interface returns a `List<Comparator<V>>` instead of a `Comparator<V>[]`.
* `T` now implements `Function<Element,Object>`.
* Added `ElementValueComparator` and `ElementFunctionComparator` in support of vendor introspection on `ComparatorHolder`-steps.
* Renamed `Comparing` marker interface to `ComparatorHolder`.
* `FunctionHolder` interface provides vendor introspection via `ElementValueFunction`.
* Removed `OrderByStep` as it is now just `order()` with a `by()`-based comparator.
* Added `SampleStep` (`sample()`) to allow for sampling the set of previous objects. Useful for doing random walks with `local()`.
* Renamed `random()` to `coin()` to better express that the filter is a random coin toss.
* Added `by()`-projection to modulate the meaning of post-processing steps like `aggregate()`, `groupCount()`, `path()`, `order()`, etc.
* Removed the `Strategy` interface and gave `StrategyGraph` direct access to the `GraphStrategy`.
* Added `Graph.strategy()` to help instantiate `StrategyGraph` instances.
* Modified the signature of all `GraphStrategy` methods to include an parameter that contains a reference to the "composing strategy".
* `PartitionStrategy` hides the specified partition key from view when iterating properties, keys, etc.
* Change construction of `GraphStrategy` implementations to be consistent with singleton instances and builder pattern.
* Added `Graph.Helper` annotation to "protected" certain default interface methods from implementation by vendors.
* Transaction retry functions now work with "manual" transactions.
* Improved error messaging when importing "legacy" GraphSON that was not generated with "extended" properties.
* Renamed "iterator" related methods in the `GraphStrategy` interface to be consistent with the method names they represent.
* `PropertyMapStep` (`valueMap()`) now takes a boolean to state if the tokens of the element are desired along with its properties.
* `HadoopGraph` now connected to the `StructureProcessSuite`.
* `HadoopGraph` no longer supports `Graph.Variables` as they were in-memory. A persistence mechanism can be introduced in the future.
* Hidden properties removed in favor of using `GraphStrategy` for such features.
* `Edge.iterators().vertexIterator(BOTH)` now guarantees `OUT` then `IN` vertex iterator order.
* `Graph.v(Object)` and `Graph.e(Object)` no longer exist. Instead, use `Graph.V(Object... ids)` and `Graph.E(Object... ids)`.
* Added `Graph.Iterators` to allow access to vertex and edge iterators based on element ids and bypassing `GraphTraversal`.
* Renamed `GraphStrategy` implementations to be less verbose - removed the word "Graph" from their names (e.g. `IdGraphStrategy` simply changed to `IdStrategy`).
* Removed `Step.NO_OBJECT` as the problem is solves can be solved with proper use of `flatMap` and `EmptyTraverser`.
* `Path` is now part of `GraphSerializer` and thus, not specific to a particular implementation of `Path`.
* Added messaging to show files being downloaded when using the Gremlin Server "install" command.
* Added test name and class arguments to the `GraphProvider.loadGraphWith` method.
* Merged `ReferencedXXX` and `DetachedXXX` so that all migration of graph element data is via `DetachedXXX`.
* Added `StaticVertexProgram` and `StaticMapReduce` which simply return `this` on `clone()`.
* `VertexProgram` and `MapReduce` now implement `Cloneable` and is used for fast copying across workers within the same machine.
* Added `TraversalHolder` interface which extends `PathConsumer` to determine recursively if nested traversals require path calculations turned on.
* Reworked how a `TraverserGenerator` is retrieved and utilized.
* Added `Traversal.toBulkSet()` to make getting resultant data more efficiently for traversals with repeated data.
* Provided a helper `LocalStep.isLocalStarGraph()` so `GraphComputer` implementers know the requisite data boundaries.
* Created `Traversal.Admin` to hide administrative methods. Added `Traversal.asAdmin()` to get at `Traversal.Admin`.
* Fixed up all `Step` cloning operations realizing that Java8 lambdas are always bound to the calling class (no delegates).
* Usage of `:remote close` without configured remotes shows a reasonable message rather than a stack trace.
* Provided `LocalStep` to signify that the internal traversal is locally bound to the incoming object.
* Failed script evaluation in Gremlin Server now triggers the cancel of the process attempting to timeout the script if it were to run too long.
* Greatly increased the speed of `ScriptEngineLambda` by making use of a static `ScriptEngine` cache.
* Fixed a general bug in all sideEffect using steps where the sideEffect should be accessed via the `Traverser` not `Traversal`.
* `GremlinPlugin` interface no longer has the `additionalDependencies` method - those dependencies are now defined by an entry in the manifest file for the jar called `Gremlin-Plugin-Dependencies`.
* Added `TinkerWorkerPool` which is used for resource efficient threading in `TinkerGraphComputer`.
* `MapReduce.createMapReduce(Configuration)` now exists and serves the same purpose as `VertexProgram.createVertexProgram(Configuration)`.
* Enabled SessionOps to be extended. Added eval handler hook.
* Setting a property with an unsupported data type throw `IllegalArgumentException` instead of `UnsupportedOperationException` as the operation is supported, but the argument is not.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M6 (Release Date: December 2, 2014)

* `javatuples.Pair` avoided on `MapReduce` API in favor of a new `KeyValue` class.
* Renamed `Gremlin-Plugin` manifest entry for plugins to `Gremlin-Plugin-Paths`.
* Added `Gremlin-Plugin-Dependencies` manifest entry to list other dependencies that should be retrieved with a plugin jar.
* `Memory.Admin.asImmutable()` yields an immutable representation of the GraphComputer `Memory`.
* Fixed host selection in `gremlin-driver` by properly accounting for all hosts being marked unavailable at the instantiation of a `Client`.
* Removed Giraph-Gremlin in favor of new Hadoop-Gremlin with `GiraphGraphComputer` support. Future support for `MapReduceGraphComputer`.
* Greatly simplified the `InputFormat` and `OutputFormat` model for working with Giraph (and Hadoop).
* Added a serializer for `Property` for GraphSON correcting format of serialization of a single `Property` on an `Edge`.
* Fixed bug in Gremlin Console that prevented assignments to empty `List` objects.
* Added `VertexProgram.getMessageScopes()` to allow vendors to know which `MessageScopes` at a particular `Memory` state.
* Reduced the number of methods in `MessageScope.Local` as its up to vendors to inspect provided incident `Traversal` accordingly.
* Renamed `MessagesType` to `MessageScope` to make it less ambiguous regarding the class of the messages being sent.
* Changed the message type of `TraversalVertexProgram` to `TraverserSet` to support message combining.

* Added `GraphTraversal.withSack()` and renamed `trackPaths()` and `with()` to `withPath()` and `withSideEffect()`, respectively.
* Added the "Gremlin Sacks" feature to allow a `Traverser` to carry local information along its walk.

* Added `DoubleIterator` to make vendor implementations of `Edge.iterators().vertexIterator()` efficient.
* `PropertiesStep` is smart about hiddens vs. properties.
* `Element.iterators().hiddenProperties()` no longer exists. For vendors, simply provide an iterator of properties.

* Provided a way to clean the `grapes` directory as part of a standard build with `mvn clean install`.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M5 (Release Date: November 7, 2014)

* Removed `PropertyFilterIterator` as using Java8 streams was just as efficient for the use case.
* Renamed `KryoWritable` to `GremlinWritable` as it is not necessarily Kryo that is the serialization mechanism.
* Fixed an input split bug in Giraph that was making it so that splits were not always at vertex boundaries.
* Fixed a combiner bug in `GirapGraphComputer`. Combiners were always calling `MapReduce.reduce()`, not `MapReduce.combine()`.
* Greatly simplified `SubgraphStrategy` by removing requirements for `Traversal` introspection.
* `StrategyWrappedGraph` mimics vendor use of `GraphStep` and `GraphTraversal` and no longer requires dynamic strategy application.
* `TraversalStrategies` make use of a dependency tree sorting algorithm to ensure proper sorts prior to application.
* `TraversalStrategies` are now immutable and are bound to the `Traversal` class.
* Fixed bug in Gephi Plugin that prevented it from communicating with the Gephi Streaming Server.
* Renamed `MessageType.XXX.to()` to `MessageType.XXX.of()` so it makes sense in both the sending and receiving context.
* Improved messaging with respect to tests that are ignored due to features to make it clear that those tests are not in error.
* Relaxed exception consistency checks in the test suite to only check that a thrown exception from an implementation extends the expected exception class (but no longer validates that it is the exact class or that the message text).
* `VertexProgram` now has `workerIterationStart()` and `workerIterationEnd()` to allow developers to control vertex split static data structures.
* `TraversalVertexProgram` startup time greatly reduced due to being smart about `loadState()` behavior.
* Gremlin Server sessions now allow serialization of results that were part of an open transaction.
* Refactor `OpProcessors` implementations in Gremlin Server for better reusability.
* `Vertex.iterators()` no longer have a `branchFactor`. This is now at the query language level with `localLimit()`.
* Added `limit(long)` and `localLimit(int,int)` which simply call the range equivalents with 0 as the low.
* Added `LocalRangeStep` which supports ranging the edges and properties of an element -- `localRange(int,int)`.
* `GraphTraversal.value(String)` no longer exists. Instead, use `GraphTraversal.values(String)`.
* `HiddenXXXStep` and `ValueXXXStep` no longer exist. `PropertyXXXStep` takes a `PropertyType` to denote value and hidden access.
* Added `PropertyType` to the structure-package which provide markers for denoting property types (vs. property classes).
* Renamed `setWorkingDirectory` to `workingDirectory` in the `KryoReader` builder.
* `Path.get(String)` returns the object if only one object is referenced by label, else it returns a `List` of referenced objects.
* Added overload to `GremlinKryo` to allow a serializer to be configured as a `Function<Kryo,Serializer>` to allow better flexibility in serializer creation.
* Added method to `GraphProvider` to allow implementers to provide a mechanism to convert GraphSON serialized identifiers back to custom identifiers as needed.
* Added methods to `GraphProvider` so that implementers could specify a custom built `GremlinKryo` class and/or `SimpleModule` class in case their implementation had custom classes to be serialized.
* Added `Traversal.forEachRemaining(class,consumer)` for those traversals whose end type is different from declared due to strategy rewriting.
* Removed `Traversal.forEach()` as traversal implements `Iterator` and users should use `forEachRemaining()`.
* `RangeStep` now has an inclusive low and an exclusive high -- a change from Gremlin2.
* `DriverGremlinPlugin` returns raw results with driver results available via the `result` variable.
* Removed test enforcement of `private` constructor for a `Graph` instance.
* `RemoteAcceptor` now supports `@` prefixed lines that will grab the script string from the Gremlin Console shell.
* Modified the signature of `Property.element()` to simply return `Element`
* Added `Reducing` marker and `ReducingStrategy` which supports reduction-functions as a final step in Gremlin OLAP (e.g. `fold()`).
* Once strategies are `complete()`, no more steps can be added to a `Traversal`.
* Renamed `Traversal.strategies()` to `Traversal.getStrategies()` as it is not a "query language"-method.
* Added test to enforce that a `label` on a `VertexProperty` is always set to the key of the owning property.
* Fixed bug with multi-property removal in `Neo4jGraph`.
* Bumped to Neo4j 2.1.5.
* Used standard `UUIDSerializer` from the `kryo-serializers` library for serialization of `UUID` objects.
* Changed GraphSON serialization to only use `iterators()` - there were still remnants of `Traversal` usage from previous refactoring.
* Added overload for `detach` method to allow for the `Element` to be detached as a "reference" only (i.e. without properties).
* Renamed `Item` in `gremlin-driver` to `Result`.
* Renamed `strategy` to `getStrategy` in `StrategyWrappedGraph`.
* Renamed `baseGraph` to `getBaseGraph` in `Neo4jGraph`.
* `Neo4jGraph` now returns an empty property `Vertex.property(k)` when the key is non-existent (a problem only visible when meta/multi property configuration was turned off).
* `Traversal.Strategies.apply()` now takes a `TraversalEngine`. Greatly simplifies strategy application for `STANDARD` or `COMPUTER`.
* Renamed `IdentityReductionStrategy` to `IdentityRemovalStrategy` for reasons of clarity.
* Added `ComparingRemovalStrategy` that removes `Comparing`-marked steps unless they are the end step of the traversal.
* `OrderStep` now works in OLAP, but only makes sense as a traversal end step.
* `MapReduce` API extended to include `getMapKeySort()` and `getReduceKeySort()` to sort outputs accordingly.
* Renamed `TraversalResultMapReduce` to `TraverserMapReduce`. Shorter and makes more sense.
* Improved build automation to package javadocs and asciidoc documentation in the distribution files.
* Improved build automation with a script to automatically bump release versions in the various files that needed it such as the `pom.xml` files.
* The identifier on `VertexProperty` is now read properly to those graphs that can support identifier assignment.
* `GraphSONReader.readGraph()` now properly reads vertex properties.
* Removed `Neo4jGraph.getCypher()` as users should use `Neo4jGraph.cypher()` and get back TinkerPop3 graph objects.
* `GiraphGraph.variables().getConfiguration()` is now replaced by `GiraphGraph.configuration()`.
* Added `Graph.configuration()` which returns the `Configuration` object of `Graph.open()`.
* Removed `TraverserTracker` as now there is only a `TraverserSet` for all halted traversers. A nice simplification of `TraversalVertexProgram`.
* Renamed `Traverser.isDone()` to `Traverser.isHalted()` and `DONE` to `HALT`. Consistent with automata terminology.
* Removed `PathTraverserExecutor` and `SimpleTraverserExecutor` as a single `TraverserExecutor` correctly executes both types of traversers.
* `TraversalVertexProgram` does "reflexive message passing" to reduce the total number of iterations required to execute a traversal.
* `MapReduce` no-argument constructors are private and thus, only for reflection and `loadState()` usage.
* MapReducers for `TraversalVertexProgram` are now smart about `with()` declared data structures.
* Updated `Traversal.SideEffects` to use "registered suppliers" and it now works accordingly in both OLTP and OLAP environments.
* Increased the speed of `FlatMapStep` by approximately 1.5x.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M4 (Release Date: October 21, 2014)

* Added features for `VertexProperty` user supplied ids and related data types.
* Removed `SideEffectCap` marker interface as there is only one `SideEffectCapStep` and thus, `instanceof` is sufficient.
* `Path.getObjects()`/`Path.getLabels()` renamed to `Path.objects()`/`Path.labels()` to be in line with "query language" naming convention.
* Greatly simplified `GiraphInternalVertex` due to `Element.graph()` -- 1/2 the memory footprint and reduced construction time.
* Renamed `Property.getElement()` to `Property.element()` given the "query language" naming convention.
* `Element.graph()` added which returns the `Graph` that the element is contained within.
* Added tests for greater consistency around iterating hidden properties.
* Simplified `TraversalVertexProgram` where only a single `TraverserTracker` exists for both path- and simple-traversers.
* Fixed a major bug where `Arrays.binarySearch` was being used on an unsorted array in TinkerGraph and Neo4jGraph.
* Changed `ComputerResult.getXXX()` to `graph()` and `memory()` to be consistent with "query language" naming convention.
* `Traverser.getXXX()` changed to `loops()`, `bulk()`, `path()`, `sideEffects()` to be consistent with "query language" naming convention.
* Optimization to reduce the number of empty lists created due to no step class existing for respective `TraversalStrategy.apply()`.
* Added `CapTraversal` as a marker interface for the `cap()` method.
* Added `union()` with GraphComputer `UnionLinearStrategy`.
* `TimeLimitStep` was moved to `filter/` package. It was a mistake that it was in `sideEffect/`.
* Provided the configuration for generating both a "full" and "core" set of javadocs, where "full" represents all classes in all projects and "core" is the "user" subset.
* Validated bindings passed to Gremlin Server to ensure that they do not match the most common statically imported values.
* If no script engine name is provided to a `LambdaHolder` it is assumed to be Gremlin-Groovy.
* `MapEmitter` and `ReduceEmitter` have an `emit(value)` default method where the key is the `MapReduce.NullObject` singleton.
* `Traverser.Admin` now implements `Attachable` as the `Traversal.SideEffects` can be generated from the `Vertex`.
* Made a solid effort to ensure that all TinkerPop keys are `Graph.System` to leave `Graph.Key` for users.
* The `Graph.System` prefix is now `^` instead of `%&%`. Simpler and easier on the `toString()`-eyes.
* Added `Traversal.SideEffects.ifPresent(Consumer)` as a default helper method.
* Added `profile()`-step which provides detailed information about the performance of each step in a traversal.
* No more `CountCapStep` and `CountStep`, there is only `CountStep` and it is elegant.
* Created a `AbstractTraversalStrategy` with good `toString()`, `hasCode()`, and `equals()` implementations.
* Added `CountTraversal` as a marker-interface stating that the `Traversal` has a `count() -> Long` method.
* `Traversal` no longer has any step methods as its not required for DSL implementers to have "core steps."
* Added "linearization" strategy for `ChooseStep` so it is executed correctly on GraphComputer.
* Added `GraphTraversalStrategyRegistry` which has respective global strategies to make turning on/off strategies easier.
* Added a generic `BranchStep` to be used for re-writing "meta-steps" for execution on GraphComputer.
* Moved `JumpStep`, `UntilStep`, and `ChooseStep` to a new `branch/` package.
* Added test cases to the Structure Suite to enforce consistent operations of reading properties after removal of their owning `Element`.
* GraphSON format change for full `Graph` serialization - Graph variables are now serialized with the key "variables" as opposed to "properties".
* Relaxed `Graph.toString()` test requirements for implementers.
* Made the `toString` operations in `GraphStrategy` consistent.
* Added `VertexFeatures.supportsRemoveProperty`.
* Added `VertexPropertyFeatures.supportsRemoveProperty`.
* Added `EdgeFeatures.supportsRemoveProperty`.
* Added `VertexFeatures.supportsRemoveVertices`.
* Added `EdgeFeatures.supportsRemoveEdges`.
* Vendors should now get a clear error when mis-spelling something in an `@OptOut` (or more likely if a test name changes) and it now works all the test suites.
* All plugins now have a default prefix of "tinkerpop." as a namespace.
* `GraphComputer` now executes a `Set<MapReduce>` and `hashCode()`/`equals()` were implemented for existing `MapReduce` implementations.
* Changed `Contains.in/notin` to `Contains.within/without` as `in` is a reserved term in most languages (including Java and Groovy).
* Added helper methods for loading data into collections in `TraversalHelper`.
* Core `Traversal` methods are smart about bulking -- e.g. `iterate()`, `fill()`, `remove()`, etc.
* `GroupByStep` and `GroupByMapReduce` leverage `BulkSet` as the default group data structure.
* `Element.Iterator` has renamed methods so implementers can do `MyElement implements Element, Element.Iterators`.
* Renamed `MessageType.Global` and `MessageType.Local` creators from `of()` to `to()` as it makes more sense to send messages `to()`.
* With `Traverser.get/setBulk()` there is no need for a `TraverserMessage`. The `Traverser` is now the message in `TraversalVertexProgram`.
* Provided static `make()` methods for constructing `Path` implementations.
* Provided a more space/time efficient algorithm for `Path.isSimple()`.
* The `JumpStep` GraphComputer algorithm `Queue` is now a `TraverserSet`.
* `AggregateStep` and `StoreStep` now use `BulkSet` as their default backing `Collection` (much more space/time efficient).
* Added `BulkSet` which is like `TraverserSet` but for arbitrary objects (i.e. a weighted set).
* `UnrollJumpStrategy` is no longer a default strategy as it is less efficient with the inclusion of `TraverserSet`.
* Introduced `TraverserSet` with bulk updating capabilities. Like OLAP, OLTP looping is now linear space/time complexity.
* TinkerGraph's MapReduce framework is now thread safe with a parallel execution implementation.
* Added a default `Traverser.asAdmin()` method as a typecast convenience to `Traverser.Admin`.
* Renamed `Traverser.System` to `Traverser.Admin` as to not cause `java.lang.System` reference issues.
* Renamed `Memory.Administrative` to `Memory.Admin` to make it shorter and consistent with `Traverser.Admin`.
* Fixed a TinkerGraph bug around user supplied vertex property ids.
* Most `Step` classes are now defined as `public final class` to prevent inheritance.
* `ShuffleStep` now extends `BarrierStep` which enables semantically correct step-sideEffects.
* Leveraged `Traverser.getBulk()` consistently throughout all steps.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M3 (Release Date: October 6, 2014)

* All `Step` fields are now `private`/`protected` with respective getters as currently needed and will be added to as needed.
* Gremlin Server no longer has the `traverse` operation as lambdas aren't really serialized.
* `Path` is now an interface with `ImmutablePath` and `MutablePath` as implementations (2x speedup on path calculations).
* `Traverser` now implements `Comparable`. If the underlying object doesn't implement `Comparable`, then a runtime exception.
* Added abstract `BarrierStep` which greatly simplifies implementing barriers like `AggregateStep`, `OrderStep`, etc.
* `SelectStep` is now intelligent about when to trigger path computations based on label selectors and barriers.
* `T` no longer has `eq`, `neq`, `lt`, `in`, etc. Renamed all respective enums and with `static import`, good in console (e.g. `Compare.eq`).
* Added `Order` enum which provides `Order.decr` and `Order.incr`.
* `Traverser.loops` and `Jump.loops` are now shorts (`32767` max-loops is probably sufficient for 99.9999% of use cases).
* `Traverser.bulk` exists which is how many instances does the traverser represent. For use in grouping with bulk computations.
* Greatly simplified sideEffect steps where there is no distinction between OLAP vs. OLTP (from the `Step` perspective).
* Removed the need for `Bulkable` and `VertexCentric` marker interfaces in process API.
* Renamed configuration parameters in Giraph-Gremlin to be consistent with a `giraph.gremlin`-prefix.
* Made it possible to pass a `ScriptEngine` name and string script in `TraversalVertexProgram` and `LambdaVertexProgram`.
* Made `TinkerGraph` a plugin for the Console as it is no longer a direct dependency in `gremlin-groovy`.
* Added features for supporting the addition of properties via `Element.property(String,Object)`.
* `GiraphGraph` OLTP tested against Gremlin-Java8 and Gremlin-Groovy -- OLAP tested against Gremlin-Groovy.
* `Neo4jGraph` is now tested against both Gremlin-Java8 and Gremlin-Groovy.
* Renamed the test cases in `ProcessTestSuite` to be consistent with other Gremlin language variants.
* Added a `gremlin-groovy-test` suite that can be used to validate implementations against the Groovy variant of Gremlin.
* `TinkerGraph` is no longer serializable, use a `GraphReader`/`GraphWriter` to serialize the graph data.
* Removed `implements Serializable` on numerous classes to ensure safety and proper usage of utilities for cloning.
* `Traversal` now implements `Cloneable` as this is the means that inter-JVM threads are able to get sibling `Traversals`.
* Created "integration" test for `Neo4jGraph` that runs the test suite with multi/meta property features turned off.
* Added `GraphStrategy` methods for `VertexProperty`.
* Converted the `id` data type from string to integer in the Grateful Dead sample data.
* Removed all notions of serializable lambdas as this is a misconception and should not be part of TinkerPop.
* Greatly simplified `TraversalVertexProgram` with three arguments: a `Traversal<Supplier>`, `Class<Traversal<Supplier>>`, or a script string with `ScriptEngine` name.
* Added `TraversalScript` interface with `GroovyTraversalScript` as an instance. To be used by OLAP engines and any language variant (e.g. gremlin-scala, gremlin-js, etc.).
* `UntilStep` now leverages `UnrollJumpStrategy` accordingly.
* Fixed a bug where the `toString()` of `Traversal` was being hijacked by `SugarGremlinPlugin`.
* Fixed compilation bug in `UntilStep` that is realized when used in multi-machine OLAP.
* Simplified `Enumerator` and implementations for `MatchStep`.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M2 (Release Date: September 23, 2014)

* Added an exhaust `InnerJoinEnumerator` fix in `MatchStep` to get all solutions correctly.
* `Neo4jGraph` can be configured to allow or disallow meta- and multi-properties.
* Added `until()`-step as a simpler way to express while-do looping which compiles down to a `jump()`-step equivalent.
* Added "The Crew" (`CREW`) toy graph which contains multi-properties, meta-properties, graph variables, hiddens, etc.
* If the Giraph job fails, then the subsequent `MapReduce` jobs will not execute.
* Added `Graph.System` class which generates keys prefixed with `%&%` which is considered the vendor namespace and not allowed by users.
* Added `ReferencedVertex` (etc. for all graph object types) for lightweight message passing of graph object ids.
* `T.*` now has `label`, `id`, `key`, `value` and no longer are these `String` representations reserved in TinkerPop.
* `Traverser` now has a transient reference to `Traversal.SideEffects`.
* "Detached" classes are now tested by the standard test suite.
* Compartmentalized `Traverser` interface so there is now a `Traverser.System` sub-interface with methods that users shouldn't call.
* Added `OrderByStep` which orders `Elements` according to the value of a provided key.
* 2x speed increase on steps that rely heavily on `ExpandableStepIterator` with massive memory footprint reduction as well.
* Added `VertexProperty<V>` as the property type for vertices -- provides multi-properties and properties on properties for vertices.
* Changed `VertexProgram` such that `getElementComputeKeys()` is simply a `Set<String>`.
* Significant changes to the format of the `ResponseMessage` for Gremlin Server - these changes break existing clients.
* Close any open transactions on any configured `Graph` when a session in Gremlin Server is killed.
* Grateful Dead Graph now uses vertex labels instead of "type" properties.
* There is now a `GraphComputerStrategy` and `EngineDependent` marker interface to allow steps to decide their algorithm depending if they are OLAP or OLTP.
* A labeled step now stores its current traverser value in `Traversal.SideEffects` (no longer can sideEffectKeys and step labels be the same).
* `GraphFactory` support for opening a `Graph` with multiple `GraphStrategy` instances - if there are multiple strategies they are wrapped in order via `SequenceGraphStrategy`.
* The result type for result termination messages returned from Gremlin Server is now set to "no content".
* The `maxContentLength` setting for Gremlin Driver now blocks incoming frames that are too large.
* After initialization scripts are executed in Gremlin Server, the `Graph` instances are re-bound back to their global references, thus allowing `GraphStrategy` initialization or even dynamic `Graph` creation through scripts.
* Added "Modern" graph back which is basically the "Classic" graph with double values for the "weight" property on edges and non-default vertex labels.
* `Traversal.addStep()` is now hard typed so type casting isn't required and traversal APIs look clean.
* Changed the hidden key prefix from `%$%` to `~` in `Graph.Key.hide()`.
* Added `has(label,key,predicate,value)` to allow for `has('person','name','marko')`. Various overloaded methods provided.
* Update to traversal API where if a `SFunction<S,?>` was required, but can process a `Traverser<S>`, then the function is `SFunction<Traverser<S>,?>`.
* Added `WhereStep` as a way to further constrain `select()` and `match()`.
* Extensive work on `GiraphMemory` and its interaction with Giraph aggregators.
* If the input path of a `GiraphGraphComputer` does not exist, failure happens prior to job submission.
* `SugarPlugin` now has all inefficient methods and Gremlin-Groovy proper is only efficient Groovy techniques.
* Prevented concurrency problems by only modifying bindings within the same thread of execution in the `GremlinExecutor`.
* Calls to `use` on the `DependencyManager` now return the list of `GremlinPlugin` instances to initialize instead of just initializing them automatically because it causes problems with `ScriptEngine` setup if a plugin requires a script to be evaluated and a required dependency is not yet loaded.
* `Traversal.SideEffects` has `getGraph()`, `setGraph()`, and `removeGraph()` default helpers.
* `Traversal.Memory` -> `Traversal.SideEffects` and `GraphComputer.SideEffects` -> `GraphComputer.Memory`.
* `StrategyWrappedVertex` and `StrategyWrappedEdge` properly wrap `Element` objects returned from non-traversal based methods.
* Gremlin-Server now sends a single write with status 200 for Object and empty response messages.
* `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine` allows imports to re-import dependencies added via "use".
* Changed order in which the `GremlinExecutor` is initialized such that dependency loading via "use" are handled first which fixes problems with starting Gremlin Server with `gremlin-server-neo4j.yaml`.
* Corrected issues with the "branch factor" related traversals under `SubgraphStrategy`.  This change also altered the semantics of the `SubgraphStrategy` a bit as it became more restrictive around `Edge` inclusion (requires both vertices to be in the subgraph).
* The Gephi Plugin now visualizes traversals and has numerous configuration options.
* Added more specific features around the types of "identifiers" a graph can support.
* Added a new test graph called `MODERN` that is copy of the `CLASSIC` graph, but represents floats as doubles.  This graph will be the default graph for testing going forward.
* Fix bug in `Neo4jGraph` that was not processing multiple vertex labels properly when doing a `has()` step with `IN`.
* Changed semantics of `@LoadGraphWith` in gremlin-test to only refer to the ability of a test implementation to process the data types of the test graph (not to actually load it).
* `StartStep` is a `SideEffect` as it is a process to get data into the stream (like a keyboard) and more efficient as such.
* Greatly simplified the implementations of `Map`, `FlatMap`, `Filter`, and `SideEffect`.
* `Path` data structure changed to an ordered list of objects with each associated to a `Set<String>` of as-labels.
* All sideEffect-based steps no longer extend `FilterStep` with predicate equal true, but a more efficient `SideEffectStep`.
* `TreeStep` now has `TreeMapReduce` for executing on `GraphComputer`.
* `Neo4jTraversal.cypher()` is fluent throughout.
* Reverted back to TP2 model of `as()` referring to step names, not variable names of sideEffects.
* Updated `AddEdge`-step to support property key/value pairs for appending to newly created edges.
* Renamed `Graph.getFeatures()` to `Graph.features()` to be consistent with other API methods.
* `Vertex` and `Edge` now implement all `GraphTraversal` methods to ensure consistency throughout stack.
* `Neo4jTraversal` is auto-generated from `Neo4jTraversalStub` with technique generalizable to other vendors.
* Added test suite to ensure that all traversals are of the same type: `g.V`, `g.E`, `g.of()`, `v.identity()`, `e.identity()`, v-, e-methods.
* Giraph HDFS helpers now support `hdfs.mkdir(string)` and `local.mkdir(string)`
* Added `@OptIn` and `@OptOut` for implementers to specify on their `Graph` implementations for test compliance information.
* `GraphComputer` `Memory` now immutable after computation is complete.
* Dependency grabbing for plugins filter out slf4j logging dependencies so as to avoid multiple bindings with the standard TinkerPop distributions.
* Fixed `GiraphMemory` to be fully consistent with GraphComputer specification.
* Removed fatJar assembly from Giraph-Graph as it is no longed needed with distributed cache model.
* Reworked `GiraphRemoteAcceptor` to provide a `result` variable back to the console with `ComputerResult`.
* `VertexProgram` is no longer `Serializable` (use `loadState` and `storeState` for wire-propagation).
* Moved `GiraphGraph.getOutputGraph()` to `GiraphHelper`.
* Changed `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_HOME` to `GIRAPH_GREMLIN_LIB` to reference directory where jars are to be loaded.
* Updated README with release instructions.

=== TinkerPop 3.0.0.M1 (Release Date: August 12, 2014)

* First official release of TinkerPop3 and thus, no changes.
