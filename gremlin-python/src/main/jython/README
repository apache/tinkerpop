Apache TinkerPop - Gremlin Python
=================================

`Apache TinkerPop™ <http://tinkerpop.apache.org>`_
is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and
graph analytic systems (OLAP). `Gremlin <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html>`_
is the graph traversal language of
TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex
traversals on (or queries of) their application's property graph.

Gremlin-Python implements Gremlin within the Python language and can be used on any Python virtual machine including
the popular CPython machine. Python’s syntax has the same constructs as Java including "dot notation" for function
chaining ``(a.b.c)``, round bracket function arguments ``(a(b,c))```, and support for global namespaces
``(a(b()) vs a(__.b()))```. As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work with
Gremlin-Python. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin-Python that make traversals a bit more succinct.

    >>> g.V().both()[1:3].toList()
    [v[2], v[4]]
    >>> g.V().both()[1].toList()
    [v[2]]
    >>> g.V().both().name.toList()
    [lop, vadas, josh, marko, marko, josh, peter, ripple, lop, marko, josh, lop]

Please see the `reference documentation <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-python>`_
at Apache TinkerPop for more information on usage.
