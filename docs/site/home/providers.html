            <p><a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org">Apache TinkerPop</a> grows when 3<sup>rd</sup> party data systems and query languages utilize it. While Apache's distribution of TinkerPop
               does provide production ready implementations and tools, it is ultimately the larger ecosystem of providers that ensure TinkerPop's widespread adoption.
               There are two types of providers. The first are those that develop a (graph) database, (graph) processor, or (graph) analytics tool and want to
               offer their users TinkerPop-specific graph computing features. The other type of provider are language designers that have a (graph) query language they
               wish to have execute on the Gremlin traversal machine and thus, against any TinkerPop-enabled graph system.

      <h3>Data System Providers</h3>
      <p>When a data system is TinkerPop-enabled, its users are able to model their domain as a graph and analyze that graph using the <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html">Gremlin graph traversal language</a>. Furthermore, all
         TinkerPop-enabled graph systems integrate with one another allowing providers to easily expand their system's offerings as well as allowing users to choose appropriate graph technology for their
         application. Sometimes an application is best served by an in-memory, transactional graph database. Sometimes a multi-machine distributed graph database will do the job. Or perhaps the
         application requires both a distributed graph database for real-time queries and, in parallel, a Big(Graph)Data processor for batch analytics.  Whatever the application's requirements, there
         exists a TinkerPop-enabled graph system out there to meet its needs.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
         <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-8">
            At an abstract level, every data system is ultimately a "graph system" because every data system supports the representation of "things" (vertices) and their respective relationships
            to one another (edges).  For instance, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a> may have a <em>people</em>-table, where the rows denote person vertices and the columns denote properties of those individuals
            (e.g. their name and age). Moreover, that relational database may also have a <em>knows</em>-table, where two columns reference primary keys in the <em>people</em>-table and the remaining columns
            denote properties of those relationships (e.g. creation timestamp, strength of friendship, etc.). TinkerPop enables any data system to expose its implicit graph structure within the
            lexicon of vertices and edges. From there, what differentiates each TinkerPop-enabled system are the various time/space-tradeoffs that were made for representing their "graph" in-memory,
            on-disk, and across a multi-machine compute cluster. TinkerPop users have the luxury of choosing a graph system based on those design choices that are important for their application.
            Moreover, they only need to concern themselves with learning the Gremlin traversal language as every TinkerPop-enabled graph system supports Gremlin.
         </div>
         <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4">

      It is (relatively) easy for a data system to become TinkerPop-enabled. There are two interface packages that need to be implemented with one of them being optional. Once implemented
      the Gremlin traversal machine can talk to the provider's system and thus, so can any of their users' Gremlin traversals as well as any existing tools/technologies that have been designed
      to interact with a TinkerPop-enabled system.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>The Graph (required)</strong>: These foundational interfaces define the semantics of the operations on a graph, vertex, edge, and property. Once implemented, the provider's
            data system can immediately be queried using Gremlin OLTP. However, providers may want to leverage a collection of provider-specific compiler optimizations called <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#traversalstrategy">traversal strategies</a>
            which can leverage their system's unique features (e.g. global indices, vertex-centric indices, sort orders, sequential scanners, push-down predicates, etc.).
         </li>
         <br/>
         <li><strong>The GraphComputer (optional)</strong>: All OLAP-based graph processors must implement the primary graph interfaces mentioned above as well as a set of parallel-processing
            message-passing interfaces. However, it is possible for a data system to only implement the primary graph interfaces and still provide OLAP support to their users by integrating their
            system with an existing <code>GraphComputer</code> implementation such as, for example, <code>SparkGraphComputer</code> (provided in Apache's distribution
            of TinkerPop).
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Finally, there are other tools and technologies that the provider can leverage from TinkerPop such as <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server">Gremlin Server</a>, <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-console">Gremlin Console</a>, and the like. The purpose of Apache TinkerPop is to
         make it easy for providers to add graph functionality to their system and/or to build a graph system from scratch and immediately have a query language, server infrastructure, metrics/reporting
         integration, cluster-based analytics and more.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Gremlin traversal language</strong>: The primary benefit of TinkerPop is the <a href="gremlin.html">Gremlin graph traversal language</a>. This language was designed specifically for graph analysis and
            manipulation and is not complicated with an explicit JOIN syntax.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Gremlin traversal machine</strong>: Every Gremlin language variant compiles to a language agnostic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode">bytecode</a> representation. That bytecode is ultimately translated to a machine-specific traversal. It is the responsibility of the Gremlin traversal machine to execute that traversal as a
            real-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a> query or as an analytic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a> query (or both). Note that the Gremlin traversal machine is not bound to the Gremlin language. Any language can take advantage of the the
            Gremlin traversal machine by simply translating itself to Gremlin bytecode. In fact, compilers currently exist for <a href="https://github.com/twilmes/sql-gremlin">SQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dkuppitz/sparql-gremlin">SPARQL</a>. However, using alternative languages for graph computing leads to significantly more complicated queries
            and typically does not match the expressivity provided by Gremlin.
         </li>
         <li><strong>TinkerGraph</strong>: TinkerPop provides a simple, non-transactional, in-memory graph system called <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#tinkergraph-gremlin">TinkerGraph</a>. TinkerGraph is useful for exploring graphs that can fit
            in-memory, for doing tutorials and training without the overhead of database setup, etc. TinkerGraph boasts both OLTP and OLAP traversal machine support.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Gremlin Console</strong>: A command line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> is provided called <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-console">Gremlin Console</a>. This console is useful when learning TinkerPop as users can load provided datasets into a
            graph system and explore the Gremlin language without the overhead of creating a full-blown software project. Furthermore, the Gremlin Console is used extensively in production scenarios
            because it allows system administrators to interact with a local or remote graph to gather statistics, manually explore the data to ensure data integrity, and other useful tasks.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Gremlin Server</strong>: It is typical for a graph database to exist on a separate machine from the user's application code. <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server">Gremlin Server</a> bridges the network-divide
            allowing users to seamlessly submit traversals for remote execution over a web-sockets based binary protocol. If provider already has a server, they can leverage TinkerPop-specific
            components as needed (e.g. implement <code>RemoteConnection</code>). Gremlin Server also provides an HTTP-based API, support for <a href="http://ganglia.info/">Ganglia</a>/<a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a>/<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/javamanagement-140525.html">JMX</a>/more
            metrics, and a traversal routing framework for intelligent data/traversal co-location within a distributed graph database's machine cluster.
         </li>
         <li><strong>SparkGraphComputer</strong>: <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>&trade; is a Big Data OLAP processor that simplifies the creation and execution of distributed data analytics.
            <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#sparkgraphcomputer"><code>SparkGraphComputer</code></a> turns Spark
            into a Big(Graph)Data processor via the OLAP component of the Gremlin traversal machine. Users do not have to learn Spark's data processing language as Gremlin traversals execute
            over Spark. For graph system providers, they can boast Spark integration once a custom <code>InputRDD</code> (or <code>InputFormat</code>) is developed.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Hadoop support</strong>: <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a>&reg; has become a staple technology for Big Data applications. In TinkerPop, <code>SparkGraphComputer</code> can pull data
            from the Hadoop File System (<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html">HDFS</a>). TinkerPop provides a collection of Input- and OutputFormats for different graph serialization standards as well as tooling that makes it easy for users
            to <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#interacting-with-hdfs">interact with HDFS</a> from the Gremlin Console or their application.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Information on how to build implementations of the various interfaces that TinkerPop supports can be found in the <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/dev/provider/">Provider Documentation</a>.

            With the growth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a>, for which graph databases are a subclass, many new database query languages have been developed. SQL has
            always been the industry standard, but now there exists others such as <a href="http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_intro_c.html">CQL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a>,

            <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, and of course, Gremlin. Much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java virtual machine</a> is a host to multiple
            programming languages including Java, Scala, Groovy, Clojure, JavaScript, etc., the Gremlin traversal machine is a host to multiple query languages. The Gremlin traversal machine's
            instruction set ensures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing Completeness</a> and as such, any query language can compile to execute on the Gremlin traversal machine.
            There are three types of language designers. Below, each type will demonstrate the "same traversal" expressed in different languages. Ultimately, they all compile to the Gremlin traversal
            below which computes the average rating for the projects created by Gremlin's friends.

            <strong>Distinct query language</strong>: Query languages such as SQL and SPARQL are significantly different from Gremlin in that they require a special purpose compiler in order to
            generate a traversal. For this reason, <a href="https://github.com/twilmes/sql-gremlin">SQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dkuppitz/sparql-gremlin">SPARQL</a> Gremlin compilers
            currently exist. Note that, within reason, Gremlin compilers do not need to concern themselves with an optimal compilation (only a semantically correct compilation) as the Gremlin
            traversal machine will leverage traversal strategies for both compile-time and runtime optimizations. Moreover, the language designer can rest assured that queries in their language
            will be able to evaluate as either an OLTP or OLAP query. The example on the right is a SPARQL query that determines the average rating for Gremlin's friends' projects. It is because

            <strong>Gremlin language variants</strong>: There are various <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/">Gremlin language variants</a> such as <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-python">Gremlin-Python</a>. These languages
            generate Gremlin bytecode utilizing the same naming/style-conventions as Gremlin-Java. However, where appropriate, they can deviate from convention in order to take advantage of the unique expressive qualities of the host language. For instance, Gremlin-Python supports index slices, attribute access, etc.

            <strong>Domain specific languages</strong>: A users's application logic typically represents its domain in terms of real-world objects, not "vertices" and "edges." While most application developers will become comfortable writing their traversals in the vertex/edge-lexicon of Gremlin, it may be desirable to create a domain specific language for, perhaps, business users. To do so is simple. The language designer extends Traversal and interacts with an underlying GraphTraversal exposing "high-level" steps that may ultimately be composed of a complex sequence of "low-level" vertex/edge-steps. A major boon is that the DSL designer does not have to worry about compiler optimization as the "low-level" GraphTraversal representation will ultimately be subjected to traversal strategies prior to OLTP or OLAP evaluation. The example on the right is a hypothetical SocialDSL that allows users to query their graph from the perspective of people, projects, etc. and is thus bound to that graph's particular social data schema.
