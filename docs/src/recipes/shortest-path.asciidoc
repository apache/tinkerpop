Shortest Path
-------------

When working with a graph, it is often necessary to identify the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem[shortest path] between two identified vertices. The following
is a simple example that identifies the shortest path between vertex "1" and vertex "5" while traversing over out edges:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
g.addV().property(id, 1).as('1').
  addV().property(id, 2).as('2').
  addV().property(id, 3).as('3').
  addV().property(id, 4).as('4').
  addV().property(id, 5).as('5').
  addE('knows').from('1').to('2').
  addE('knows').from('2').to('4').
  addE('knows').from('4').to('5').
  addE('knows').from('2').to('3').
  addE('knows').from('3').to('4').iterate()
g.V(1).repeat(out().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).path().limit(1)     <1>
g.V(1).repeat(out().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).path().count(local) <2>
g.V(1).repeat(out().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).path().
  group().by(count(local)).next()                                     <3>
----

<1> The traversal starts at vertex with the identifier of "1" and repeatedly traverses on out edges "until" it finds a
vertex with an identifier of "5". The inclusion of `simplePath` within the `repeat` is present to filter out repeated
paths. The traversal terminates with `limit` in this case as the first path returned will be the shortest one. Of
course, it is possible for there to be more than one path in the graph of the same length (i.e. two or more paths of
length three), but this example is not considering that.
<2> It might be interesting to know the path lengths for all paths between vertex "1" and "5".
<3> Alternatively, one might wish to do a path length distribution over all the paths.

The previous example defines the length of the path by the number of vertices in the path, but the "path" might also
be measured by data within the graph itself. The following example use the same graph structure as the previous example,
but includes a "weight" on the edges, that will be used to help determine the "cost" of a particular path:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
g.addV().property(id, 1).as('1').
  addV().property(id, 2).as('2').
  addV().property(id, 3).as('3').
  addV().property(id, 4).as('4').
  addV().property(id, 5).as('5').
  addE('knows').from('1').to('2').property('weight', 1.25).
  addE('knows').from('2').to('4').property('weight', 1.5).
  addE('knows').from('4').to('5').property('weight', 0.25).
  addE('knows').from('2').to('3').property('weight', 0.25).
  addE('knows').from('3').to('4').property('weight', 0.25).iterate()
g.V(1).repeat(out().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).path().
  group().by(count(local)).next()                                                         <1>
g.V(1).repeat(outE().inV().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).
  path().by(coalesce(values('weight'),
                     constant(0.0))).
  map(unfold().sum())                                                                     <2>
g.V(1).repeat(outE().inV().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).
  path().by(constant(0.0)).by('weight').map(unfold().sum())                               <3>
g.V(1).repeat(outE().inV().simplePath()).until(hasId(5)).
  path().as('p').
  map(unfold().coalesce(values('weight'),
                        constant(0.0)).sum()).as('cost').
  select('cost','p')                                                                      <4>

<1> Note that the shortest path as determined by the structure of the graph is the same.
<2> Calculate the "cost" of the path as determined by the weight on the edges. As the "weight" data is on the edges
between the vertices, it is necessary to change the contents of the `repeat` step to use `outE().inV()` so that the
edge is included in the path. The path is then post-processed with a `by` modulator that extracts the "weight" value.
The traversal uses `coalesce` as there is a mixture of vertices and edges in the path and the traversal is only
interested in edge elements that can return a "weight" property. The final part of the traversal executes a map
function over each path, unfolding it and summing the weights.
<3> The same traversal as the one above it, but avoids the use of `coalesce` with the use of two `by` modulators. The
`by` modulator is applied in a round-robin fashion, so the first `by` will always apply to a vertex (as it is the first
item in every path) and the second `by` will always apply to an edge (as it always follows the vertex in the path).
<4> The output of the previous examples of the "cost" wasn't terribly useful as it didn't include which path had the
calculated cost. With some slight modifications given the use of `select` it becomes possible to include the path in
the output. Note that the path with the lowest "cost" actually has a longer path length as determined by the graph
structure.
