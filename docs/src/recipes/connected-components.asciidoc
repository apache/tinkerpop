== Connected Components

Gremlin can be used to find link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)[connected components]
in a graph. In a directed graph like in TinkerPop, components can be weakly or strongly connected. This recipe is
restricted to finding link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph#Directed_graph_connectivity[weakly
connected components], in which the direction of edges is not taken into account.

Depending on the size of the graph, three solution regimes can be discriminated:

1. Small graphs that fit in the memory of a single machine

2. Medium graphs backed by storage for which a linear scan is still feasible. This regime is left to third party
TinkerPop implementations, since TinkerPop itself has no storage-backed reference implementations. The idea is that
component membership is stored in the graph, rather than in memory.

3. Large graphs requiring an OLAP approach to yield results in a reasonable time.


These regimes are discussed separately using the following graph with three weakly connected components:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
g.addV().property(id, "A").as("a").
  addV().property(id, "B").as("b").
  addV().property(id, "C").as("c").
  addV().property(id, "D").as("d").
  addV().property(id, "E").as("e").
  addV().property(id, "F").
  addE("link").from("a").to("b").
  addE("link").from("b").to("c").
  addE("link").from("d").to("e").iterate()
----


===== Small graphs

Connected components in a small graph can be determined with both an OLTP traversal and the OLAP
`connectedComponent()`-step. The `connectedComponent()`-step is available as of TinkerPop 3.4.0 and is
described in more detail in the
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#connectedcomponent-step[Reference Documentation].

A straightforward way to detect the various subgraphs with an OLTP traversal is to do this:

[gremlin-groovy,existing]
----
g.V().emit(cyclicPath().or().not(both())).                                    <1>
    repeat(__.where(without('a')).store('a').both()).until(cyclicPath()).     <2>
    group().by(path().unfold().limit(1)).                                     <3>
    by(path().unfold().dedup().fold()).                                       <4>
    select(values).unfold()                                                   <5>
----

<1> The initial emit() step allows for output of isolated vertices, in addition to the discovery of
components as described in (2).

<2> The entire component to which the first returned vertex belongs, is visited. To allow for components of any
structure, a repeat loop is applied that only stops for a particular branch of the component when it detects a cyclic
path.  Collection `'a'` is used to keep track of visited vertices, for both subtraversals within a component
and new traversals resulting from the `g.V()` linear scan.

<3> While `'a'` nicely keeps track of vertices already visited, the actual components need to be extracted from the
path information of surviving traversers. The `path().unfold().limit(1)` closure provides the starting vertex
of surviving traversers, which can be used to group the components.

<4> This clause collects the unique vertices from all paths with the same starting vertex, thus from the same
weak component.

<5> The values of the groupby map contain the lists of vertices making up the requested components.

This algorithm completes in linear time with the number of vertices and edges, because a traversal is started for each
vertex and each edge with its associated out-vertex is visited exactly once.


==== Large graphs

Large graphs require an OLAP solution with a custom VertexProgram that can be run using a graph implementation's
GraphComputer, in particular `SparkGraphComputer` on a `HadoopGraph`. The OLAP solution also runs faster for most
medium-sized graphs, that is when these graph have a 'natural' structure with a limited maximum path length.

The TinkerPop library of vertex programs contains the `WeakComponentsVertexProgram` which can be run in the same
way as the link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#peerpressurevertexprogram[PeerPressureVertexProgram]:

[gremlin-groovy,existing]
----
result = g.getGraph().compute().
    program(WeakComponentsVertexProgram.build().maxIterations(100).create()).
    mapReduce(ClusterPopulationMapReduce.build().create()).
    mapReduce(ClusterCountMapReduce.build().create()).
    submit().get()
result.memory().clusterPopulation
gResult = result.graph().traversal()
gResult.V().valueMap(true)
----

The vertex program has interconnected vertices exchange id's and store the lowest id until no vertex receives a
lower id. This algorithm is commonly applied in
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel[bulk synchronous parallel] systems, e.g. in
link:https://spark.apache.org/graphx[Apache Spark GraphX].

==== Scalability

ToDo:
 - limits and run time regime 1
 - test of friendster graph regime 3
 - discuss: link:http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p1821-yan.pdf[http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p1821-yan.pdf]
