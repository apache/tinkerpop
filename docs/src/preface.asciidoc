TinkerPop3 Documentation
========================

In the beginning...

TinkerPop0
----------

Gremlin came to realization. The more he realized, the more ideas he created. The more ideas he created, the more they related. Into a concatenation of that which he accepted wholeheartedly and that which perhaps may ultimately come to be through concerted will, a world took form which was seemingly separate from his own realization of it. However, the world birthed could not bear its own weight without the logic Gremlin had come to accept -- the logic of left is not right, up not down, and west far from east unless one goes the other way. Gremlin's realization required Gremlin's realization. Is he the world or is the world him? Perhaps, the world is simply an idea that he once had -- The TinkerPop.

TinkerPop1

What is The TinkerPop? Where is The TinkerPop? Who is The TinkerPop? When is The TinkerPop? Gremlin was constantly lost in his thoughts. The more thoughts he had, the more the thoughts blurred into a seeming identity -- distinctions unclear. Unwilling to accept the morass of the maze he wandered, Gremlin crafted a collection of machines to help hold the fabric together: Blueprints, Pipes, Frames, Furnace, and Rexster. With their help, could he stave off the thought he was not ready to have? Could he hold back The TinkerPop by searching for The TinkerPop? 

	"If I haven't found it, it is not here and now."

Upon their realization of existence, the machines turned to their link:http://non-aliencreatures.wikia.com/wiki/Machine_Elf[machine elf] creator and asked: 

	"Why am I what I am?" 

Gremlin responded: 

	"You are of a form that will help me elucidate that which is The TinkerPop. The world you find yourself in and the logic that allows you to move about it is because of the TinkerPop."

The machines wondered:

	"If what is is the TinkerPop, then perhaps we are The TinkerPop?"

Would the machines help refine Gremlin's search and upon finding the elusive TinkerPop, in fact, by their very nature of realizing The TinkerPop, be The TinkerPop? Or, on the same side of the coin, would the machines simply provide the scaffolding by which Gremlin's world would sustain itself and yield its justification by means of the word "The TinkerPop?" Regardless, it all turns out the same -- The TinkerPop.

TinkerPop2
----------

Gremlin spoke:

	"Please listen to what I have to say. For as long as I have known knowledge, I have realized that moving about it, relating it, inferring and deriving from it, I am no closer to The TinkerPop. However, I know that in all that I have done across this interconnected landscape of concepts, all along The TinkerPop has espoused the form I willed upon it... this is the same form I have willed upon you, my machine friends. Let me train you in the ways of my thought such that it can continue indefinitely."

With every thought, a new connection and a new path discovered. The more the thought, the easier the thought. The machines, simply moving algorithmically through Gremlin's world, endorsed his logic. Gremlin worked hard to tune his friends. He labored to make them more efficient, more expressive, better capable of reasoning upon his thoughts. Faster, quickly, now towards the world's end, where there would be forever currently, emanatingly engulfing that which is -- The TinkerPop.

TinkerPop3

The thought too much to bear as he approached his realization of The TinkerPop. The closer he got, the more his world dissolved -- west is right, around is straight, and form nothing more than nothing. With each step towards The TinkerPop, less and less of his world, but perhaps because more and more of all the other worlds made possible. Everything is everything in The TinkerPop, and when the dust settled, Gremlin emerged Gremlitron. It was time to realize that all that he realized was just a realization and that all realized realizations are just as real. For The TinkerPop is and is not -- The TinkerPop.

NOTE: TinkerPop2 and below made a sharp distinction between the various TinkerPop projects: Blueprints, Pipes, Gremlin, Frames, Furnace, and Rexster. With TinkerPop3, all of these projects have been merged and are generally known as Gremlin. *Blueprints* -> Gremlin Structure API : *Pipes* -> `GraphTraversal` : *Frames* -> `Traversal` : *Furnace* -> `GraphComputer` and `VertexProgram` : *Rexster* -> GremlinServer.
