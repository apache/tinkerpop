== Gremlin Language Variants

Gremlin is an embeddable query language that can be represented using the constructs of a host programming language.
Any programming language that supports link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition[function composition]
(e.g. fluent chaining) and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_function[function nesting] (e.g. call stacks)
can support Gremlin. Nearly every modern programming language is capable of meeting both requirements.
With Gremlin, the distinction between a programming language and a query language is not as large as they
have historically been. For instance, with Gremlin-Java, the developer is able to have their application code and their
graph database queries at the same level of abstraction -- both written in Java. A simple example is presented below
where the `MyApplication` Java class contains both application-level and database-level code written in Java.

WARNING: This is an advanced tutorial intended for experts knowledgeable in Gremlin in particular and TinkerPop in general.
Moreover, the audience should understand advanced programming language concepts such as reflection, meta-programming,
source code generation, and virtual machines.

public class MyApplication {

  public static void run(final String[] args) {

    // assumes args[0] is a configuration file location
    Graph graph = GraphFactory.open(args[0]);
    GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal();

    // assumes that args[1] and args[2] are range boundaries
    Iterator<Map<String,Double>> result =
      g.V().hasLabel("product").
        order().by("unitPrice", asc).
        range(Integer.valueOf(args[1]), Integer.valueOf(args[2])).
        valueMap("name", "unitPrice")

    while(result.hasNext()) {
      Map<String,Double> map = result.next();
      System.out.println(map.get("name") + " " + map.get("unitPrice"));
    }
  }
}

In query languages like link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL[SQL], the user must construct a string representation of
their query and submit it to the database for evaluation. This is because SQL cannot be expressed in Java as they use fundamentally
different constructs in their expression. The same example above is presented below using SQL and the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity[JDBC] interface. The take home point is that Gremlin does
not exist outside the programming language in which it will be used. Gremlin was designed to be able to be
embedded in any modern programming language and thus, always free from the complexities of string manipulation as seen
in other database and analytics query languages.

  public static void run(final String[] args) {

    // assumes args[0] is a URI to the database

    // assumes that args[1] and args[2] are range boundaries
    ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(
      "SELECT Products.ProductName, Products.UnitPrice \n" +
      "  FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() \n" +
      "                   OVER ( \n" +

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to develop a _Gremlin language variant_. That is, for those developers that
are interested in supporting Gremlin in their native language and there currently does not exist a (good) Gremlin variant in
their language, they can develop one for the Apache TinkerPop community (and their language community in general). In this
tutorial, link:https://www.python.org/[Python] will serve as the host language and two typical implementation models will be presented.

1. <<using-jython-and-the-jvm,**Using Jython and the JVM**>>: This is perhaps the easiest way to produce a Gremlin
language variant. With link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223], any language compiler written for the JVM
can directly access the JVM and any of its libraries (including Gremlin-Java).

2. <<using-python-and-gremlin-server,**Using Python and GremlinServer**>>: This model requires that there exist a Python
class that mimics Gremlin-Java's `GraphTraversal` API. With each method call of this Python class, Gremlin `Bytecode` is
generated which is ultimately translated into a Gremlin variant that can execute the traversal (e.g. Gremlin-Java).

IMPORTANT: Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Java is considered the idiomatic, standard implementation of Gremlin.
Any Gremlin language variant, regardless of the implementation model chosen, **must**, within the constraints of the
host language, be in 1-to-1 correspondence with Gremlin-Java. This ensures that language variants are collectively
consistent and easily leveraged by anyone versed in Gremlin.

IMPORTANT: The "Gremlin-Python" presented in this tutorial is basic and provided to show the primary techniques used to
construct a Gremlin language variant. Apache TinkerPop distributes with a full fledged Gremlin-Python variant
that uses many of the techniques presented in this tutorial.

[[language-drivers-vs-language-variants]]
== Language Drivers vs. Language Variants

Before discussing how to implement a Gremlin language variant in Python, it is necessary to understand two concepts related to
Gremlin language development. There is a difference between a _language driver_ and a _language variant_ and it is important
that these two concepts (and their respective implementations) remain separate.

=== Language Drivers

image:language-drivers.png[width=375,float=right] A Gremlin language driver is a software library that is able to
communicate with a TinkerPop-enabled graph system whether directly via the JVM or indirectly via
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#gremlin-server[Gremlin Server] GremlinServer or some other
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#connecting-via-remotegraph[RemoteConnection] enabled graph system.
Language drivers are responsible for submitting Gremlin traversals to a TinkerPop-enabled graph system and
returning results to the developer that are within the developer's language's type system.
For instance, resultant doubles should be coerced to floats in Python.

This tutorial is not about language drivers, but about language variants. Moreover, community libraries should make this
distinction clear and **should not** develop libraries that serve both roles. Language drivers will be useful to a collection
of Gremlin variants within a language community -- able to support `GraphTraversal`-variants as well as also other
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[DSL]-variants (e.g. `SocialTraversal`).

NOTE: `GraphTraversal` is a particular Gremlin domain-specific language (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[DSL]),
albeit the most popular and foundational DSL. If another DSL is created, then the same techniques discussed in this tutorial
for `GraphTraversal` apply to `XXXTraversal`.

=== Language Variants

image:language-variants.png[width=375,float=right] A Gremlin language variant is a software library that allows a developer
to write a Gremlin traversal within their native programming language. The language variant is responsible for
creating Gremlin `Bytecode` that will ultimately be translated and compiled to a `Traversal` by a TinkerPop-enabled graph system.

Every language variant, regardless of the implementation details, will have to account for the four core concepts below:

1. `Graph` (**data**): The source of the graph data to be traversed and the interface which enables the creation of a
`GraphTraversalSource` (via `graph.traversal()`).

2. `GraphTraversalSource` (**compiler**): This is the typical `g` reference. A `GraphTraversalSource` maintains the
`withXXX()`-strategy methods as well as the "traversal spawn"-methods such as `V()`, `E()`, `addV()`, etc.
A traversal source's registered `TraversalStrategies` determine how the submitted traversal will be ultimately evaluated.

3. `GraphTraversal` (**function composition**): A graph traversal maintains the computational steps such as `out()`, `groupCount()`,
`match()`, etc. This fluent interface supports method chaining and thus, a linear "left-to-right" representation of a traversal/query.

4. `__` (**function nesting**) : The anonymous traversal class is used for passing a traversal as an argument to a parent step.
For example, in `repeat(__.out())`, `__.out()` is an anonymous traversal passed to the traversal parent `repeat()`.
Anonymous traversals enable the "top-to-bottom" representation of a traversal.

5. `Bytecode` (**language agnostic encoding**): The source and traversal steps and their arguments are encoded in a
language agnostic representation called Gremlin bytecode. This representation is a nested list of the form `[step,[args*]]*`.

Both `GraphTraversal` and `__` define the structure of the Gremlin language. Gremlin is a _two-dimensional language_ supporting
linear, nested step sequences. Historically, many Gremlin language variants have failed to make the distinctions above clear
and in doing so, either complicate their implementations or yield variants that are not in 1-to-1 correspondence with Gremlin-Java.
By keeping these concepts clear when designing a language variant, the construction of the Gremlin bytecode representation is
easy.

IMPORTANT: The term "Gremlin-Java" denotes the language that is defined by `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`,
and `__`. These three classes exist in `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.dsl.graph` and form the definitive
representation of the Gremlin traversal language.

== Gremlin-Jython and Gremlin-Python

[[using-jython-and-the-jvm]]
=== Using Jython and the JVM

image:jython-logo.png[width=200,float=left,link="http://www.jython.org/"] link:http://www.jython.org/[Jython] provides a
link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223] `ScriptEngine` implementation that enables the evaluation of
Python on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine[Java virtual machine]. In other words, Jython's
virtual machine is not the standard link:https://wiki.python.org/moin/CPython[CPython] reference implementation
distributed with most operating systems, but instead the JVM. The benefit of Jython is that Python code and classes
can easily interact with the Java API and any Java packages on the `CLASSPATH`. In general, any JSR-223 Gremlin language
variant is trivial to "implement."

----

Most every JSR-223 `ScriptEngine` language will allow the developer to immediately interact with `GraphTraversal`.
The benefit of this model is that nearly every major programming language has a respective `ScriptEngine`:
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashorn_(JavaScript_engine)[JavaScript], link:http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy],
link:http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala], Lisp (link:https://clojure.org/[Clojure]), link:http://jruby.org/[Ruby], etc. A
list of implementations is provided link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages[here].

==== Traversal Wrappers

While it is possible to simply interact with Java classes in a `ScriptEngine` implementation, such Gremlin language variants
will not leverage the unique features of the host language. It is for this reason that JVM-based language variants such as
link:https://github.com/mpollmeier/gremlin-scala[Gremlin-Scala] were developed. Scala provides many syntax niceties not
available in Java. To leverage these niceties, Gremlin-Scala "wraps" `GraphTraversal` in order to provide Scala-idiomatic extensions.
Another example is Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Groovy which does the same via the
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#sugar-plugin[Sugar plugin], but uses
link:http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html[meta-programming] instead of object wrapping, where "behind the scenes,"
Groovy meta-programming is doing object wrapping.

The Jython example below uses Python meta-programming to add functionality to `GraphTraversal`.
In particular, the `__getitem__` and `__getattr__` "magic methods" are leveraged.

[source,python]
----
def getitem_bypass(self, index):
  if isinstance(index,int):
    return self.range(index,index+1)
  elif isinstance(index,slice):
    return self.range(index.start,index.stop)
  else:
    return TypeError('Index must be int or slice')");
GraphTraversal.__getitem__ = getitem_bypass
GraphTraversal.__getattr__ = lambda self, key: self.values(key)
----

The two methods `__getitem__` and `__getattr__` support Python _slicing_ and _object attribute interception_, respectively.
In this way, the host language is able to use its native constructs in a meaningful way within a Gremlin traversal.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Java serves as the standard/default representation of the Gremlin traversal language. Any Gremlin
language variant **must** provide all the same functionality (methods) as `GraphTraversal`, but **can** extend it
with host language specific constructs. This means that the extensions **must** compile to `GraphTraversal`-specific
steps. A Gremlin language variant **should not** add steps/methods that do not exist in `GraphTraversal`. If an extension
is desired, the language variant designer should submit a proposal to link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org[Apache TinkerPop]
to have the extension added to a future release of Gremlin.

[[using-python-and-remoteconnection]]
=== Using Python and RemoteConnection

image:python-logo.png[width=125,float=left,link="https://www.python.org/"] The JVM is a powerful piece of technology that has, over the years,
become a meeting ground for developers from numerous language communities. However, not all applications will use the JVM.
Given that Apache TinkerPop is a Java-framework, there must be a way for two different virtual machines to communicate
traversals and their results. This section presents the second Gremlin language variant implementation model which does just that.

NOTE: Apache TinkerPop is a JVM-based graph computing framework. Most graph databases and processors today are built
on the JVM. This makes it easy for these graph system providers to implement Apache TinkerPop. However, TinkerPop is more
than its graph API and tools -- it is also the Gremlin traversal machine and language. While Apache's Gremlin traversal
machine was written for the JVM, its constructs are simple and can/should be ported to other VMs for those graph systems
that are not JVM-based. A theoretical review of the concepts behind the Gremlin traversal machine is provided in
link:http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03843[this article].

This section's Gremlin language variant design model does not leverage the JVM directly. Instead, it constructs a `Bytecode`
representation of a `Traversal` that will ultimately be evaluated by `RemoteConnection` (e.g. GremlinServer).
It is up to the language variant designer to choose a _language driver_ to use for submitting the generated bytecode and
coercing its results. The language driver is the means by which, for this example, the CPython
VM communicates with the JVM.

When the above Groovy script is evaluated (e.g. in GremlinConsole), **Gremlin-Python** is born. The generated Python
file is available at link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/x.y.z/gremlin-python/src/main/jython/gremlin_python/process/graph_traversal.py[graph_traversal.py].
It is important to note that there is a bit more to Gremlin-Python in that there also exists Python implementations of `TraversalStrategies`, `Traversal`, `Bytecode`, etc.
Please review the full implementation of Gremlin-Python link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/tree/x.y.z/gremlin-python/src/main/jython/gremlin_python[here].

NOTE: In practice, TinkerPop uses the Groovy's `GStringTemplateEngine` to help with the code generation task described
above and automates that generation as part of the standard build with Maven using the `gmavenplus-plugin`. See the
`gremlin-python` link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/x.y.z/gremlin-python/pom.xml[pom.xml] for more details.

Of particular importance is Gremlin-Python's implementation of `Bytecode`.

As `GraphTraversalSource` and `GraphTraversal` are manipulated, the step-by-step instructions are written to `Bytecode`.
This bytecode is simply a list of lists. For instance, `g.V(1).repeat(out('knows').hasLabel('person')).times(2).name` has
the `Bytecode` form:

[source,json]
----
[
 ["V", [1]],
 ["repeat", [[
   ["out", ["knows"]]
   ["hasLabel", ["person"]]]]]
 ["times", [2]]
 ["values", ["name"]]
]
----

This nested list representation is ultimately converted by the language variant into link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#graphson-reader-writer[GraphSON]
for serialization to a `RemoteConnection` such as GremlinServer.

[[gremlin-language-variant-conventions]]
== Gremlin Language Variant Conventions

Every programming language is different and a Gremlin language variant must ride the fine line between leveraging the
conventions of the host language and ensuring consistency with Gremlin-Java. A collection of conventions for navigating
this dual-language bridge are provided.

* If camelCase is not an accepted method naming convention in the host language, then the host language's convention can be used instead. For instance, in a Gremlin-Ruby implementation, `outE("created")` may be `out_e("created")`.
* If Gremlin-Java step names conflict with the host language's reserved words, then a consistent amelioration should be used. For instance, in Python `as` is a reserved word, thus, Gremlin-Python uses `as_`.
* If the host language does not use dot-notion for method chaining, then its method chaining convention should be used instead of going the route of operator overloading. For instance, a Gremlin-PHP implementation should do `$g->V()->out()`.
* If a programming language does not support method overloading, then varargs and type introspection should be used. In Gremlin-Python, `*args` does just that.

== Conclusion

Gremlin is a simple language because it uses two fundamental programming language constructs: *function composition*
and *function nesting*. Because of this foundation, it is relatively easy to implement Gremlin in any modern programming
language. Two ways of doing this for the Python language were presented in this tutorial. One using Jython (on the JVM) and one using Python
(on CPython). It is strongly recommended that language variant designers leverage (especially when not on the JVM)
the reflection-based source code generation technique presented. This method ensures that the language
variant is always in sync with the corresponding Apache TinkerPop Gremlin-Java release version. Moreover, it reduces
the chance of missing methods or creating poorly implemented methods. While Gremlin is simple, there are nearly 200
steps in `GraphTraversal`. As such, mechanical means of host language embedding are strongly advised.
