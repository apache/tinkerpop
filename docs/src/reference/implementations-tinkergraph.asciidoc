image:tinkerpop-character.png[width=100,float=left] TinkerGraph is a single machine, in-memory (with optional
persistence), non-transactional graph engine that provides both OLTP and OLAP functionality. It is deployed with
TinkerPop3 and serves as the reference implementation for other providers to study in order to understand the
semantics of the various methods of the TinkerPop3 API. Constructing a simple graph in Java8 is presented below.

[source,java]
Graph g = TinkerGraph.open();
Vertex marko = g.addVertex("name","marko","age",29);
Vertex lop = g.addVertex("name","lop","lang","java");
marko.addEdge("created",lop,"weight",0.6d);

The above graph creates two vertices named "marko" and "lop" and connects them via a created-edge with a weight=0.6
property. Next, the graph can be queried as such.

[source,java]
g.V().has("name","marko").out("created").values("name")

The `g.V().has("name","marko")` part of the query can be executed in two ways.

 * A linear scan of all vertices filtering out those vertices that don't have the name "marko"
 * A `O(log(|V|))` index lookup for all vertices with the name "marko"

Given the initial graph construction in the first code block, no index was defined and thus, a linear scan is executed.
However, if the graph was constructed as such, then an index lookup would be used.

[source,java]
Graph g = TinkerGraph.open();
g.createIndex("name",Vertex.class)

The execution times for a vertex lookup by property is provided below for both no-index and indexed version of
TinkerGraph over the Grateful Dead graph.

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = graph.traversal()
graph.io(graphml()).readGraph('data/grateful-dead.xml')
clock(1000) {g.V().has('name','Garcia').iterate()} <1>
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = graph.traversal()
graph.createIndex('name',Vertex.class)
graph.io(graphml()).readGraph('data/grateful-dead.xml')
clock(1000){g.V().has('name','Garcia').iterate()} <2>
----

<1> Determine the average runtime of 1000 vertex lookups when no `name`-index is defined.
<2> Determine the average runtime of 1000 vertex lookups when a `name`-index is defined.

IMPORTANT: Each graph system will have different mechanism by which indices and schemas are defined. TinkerPop3
does not require any conformance in this area. In TinkerGraph, the only definitions are around indices. With other
graph systems, property value types, indices, edge labels, etc. may be required to be defined _a priori_ to adding
data to the graph.

NOTE: TinkerGraph is distributed with Gremlin Server and is therefore automatically available to it for configuration.

=== Configuration

TinkerGraph has several settings that can be provided on creation via `Configuration` object:

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Property |Description
|gremlin.graph |`org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.tinkergraph.structure.TinkerGraph`
|gremlin.tinkergraph.vertexIdManager |The `IdManager` implementation to use for vertices.
|gremlin.tinkergraph.edgeIdManager |The `IdManager` implementation to use for edges.
|gremlin.tinkergraph.vertexPropertyIdManager |The `IdManager` implementation to use for vertex properties.
|gremlin.tinkergraph.defaultVertexPropertyCardinality |The default `VertexProperty.Cardinality` to use when `Vertex.property(k,v)` is called.
|gremlin.tinkergraph.graphLocation |The path and file name for where TinkerGraph should persist the graph data. If a
value is specified here, the `gremlin.tinkergraph.graphFormat` should also be specified.  If this value is not
included (default), then the graph will stay in-memory and not be loaded/persisted to disk.
|gremlin.tinkergraph.graphFormat |The format to use to serialize the graph which may be one of the following:
`graphml`, `graphson`, `gryo`, or a fully qualified class name that implements Io.Builder interface (which allows for
external third party graph reader/writer formats to be used for persistence).
If a value is specified here, then the `gremlin.tinkergraph.graphLocation` should
also be specified.  If this value is not included (default), then the graph will stay in-memory and not be
loaded/persisted to disk.
|=========================================================

The `IdManager` settings above refer to how TinkerGraph will control identifiers for vertices, edges and vertex
properties.  There are several options for each of these settings: `ANY`, `LONG`, `INTEGER`, `UUID`, or the fully
qualified class name of an `IdManager` implementation on the classpath.  When not specified, the default values
for all settings is `ANY`, meaning that the graph will work with any object on the JVM as the identifier and will
generate new identifiers from `Long` when the identifier is not user supplied.  TinkerGraph will also expect the
user to understand the types used for identifiers when querying, meaning that `g.V(1)` and `g.V(1L)` could return
two different vertices.  `LONG`, `INTEGER` and `UUID` settings will try to coerce identifier values to the expected
type as well as generate new identifiers with that specified type.

If the TinkerGraph is configured for persistence with `gremlin.tinkergraph.graphLocation` and
`gremlin.tinkergraph.graphFormat`, then the graph will be written to the specified location with the specified
format when `Graph.close()` is called.  In addition, if these settings are present, TinkerGraph will attempt to
load the graph from the specified location.

IMPORTANT: If choosing `graphson` as the `gremlin.tinkergraph.graphFormat`, be sure to also establish the  various
`IdManager` settings as well to ensure that identifiers are properly coerced to the appropriate types as GraphSON
can lose the identifier's type during serialization (i.e. it will assume `Integer` when the default for TinkerGraph
is `Long`, which could lead to load errors that result in a message like, "Vertex with id already exists").

It is important to consider the data being imported to TinkerGraph with respect to `defaultVertexPropertyCardinality`
setting.  For example, if a `.gryo` file is known to contain multi-property data, be sure to set the default
cardinality to `list` or else the data will import as `single`.  Consider the following:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
graph.io(gryo()).readGraph("data/tinkerpop-crew.kryo")
g = graph.traversal()
g.V().properties()
conf = new BaseConfiguration()
conf.setProperty("gremlin.tinkergraph.defaultVertexPropertyCardinality","list")
graph = TinkerGraph.open(conf)
graph.io(gryo()).readGraph("data/tinkerpop-crew.kryo")
g = graph.traversal()
g.V().properties()
