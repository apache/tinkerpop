== Features

A `Feature` implementation describes the capabilities of a `Graph` instance. This interface is implemented by graph
system providers for two purposes:

. It tells users the capabilities of their `Graph` instance.
. It allows the features they do comply with to be tested against the Gremlin Test Suite - tests that do not comply are "ignored").

The following example in the Gremlin Console shows how to print all the features of a `Graph`:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
graph.features()
----

A common pattern for using features is to check their support prior to performing an operation:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph.features().graph().supportsTransactions()
graph.features().graph().supportsTransactions() ? g.tx().commit() : "no tx"
----

TIP: To ensure provider agnostic code, always check feature support prior to usage of a particular function.  In that
way, the application can behave gracefully in case a particular implementation is provided at runtime that does not
support a function being accessed.

[[vertex-properties]]
== Vertex Properties

image:vertex-properties.png[width=215,float=left] TinkerPop introduces the concept of a `VertexProperty<V>`. All the
properties of a `Vertex` are a `VertexProperty`. A `VertexProperty` implements `Property` and as such, it has a
key/value pair. However, `VertexProperty` also implements `Element` and thus, can have a collection of key/value
pairs. Moreover, while an `Edge` can only have one property of key "name" (for example), a `Vertex` can have multiple
"name" properties. With the inclusion of vertex properties, two features are introduced which ultimately advance the
graph modelers toolkit:

. Multiple properties (*multi-properties*): a vertex property key can have multiple values.  For example, a vertex can have
multiple "name" properties.
. Properties on properties (*meta-properties*): a vertex property can have properties (i.e. a vertex property can
have key/value data associated with it).

Possible use cases for meta-properties:

. *Permissions*: Vertex properties can have key/value ACL-type permission information associated with them.
. *Auditing*: When a vertex property is manipulated, it can have key/value information attached to it saying who the
creator, deletor, etc. are.
. *Provenance*: The "name" of a vertex can be declared by multiple users.  For example, there may be multiple spellings
of a name from different sources.

A running example using vertex properties is provided below to demonstrate and explain the API.

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = graph.traversal()
v = g.addV().property('name','marko').property('name','marko a. rodriguez').next()
g.V(v).properties('name').count() <1>
v.property(list, 'name', 'm. a. rodriguez') <2>
g.V(v).properties('name').count()
g.V(v).properties()
g.V(v).properties('name')
g.V(v).properties('name').hasValue('marko')
g.V(v).properties('name').hasValue('marko').property('acl','private') <3>
g.V(v).properties('name').hasValue('marko a. rodriguez')
g.V(v).properties('name').hasValue('marko a. rodriguez').property('acl','public')
g.V(v).properties('name').has('acl','public').value()
g.V(v).properties('name').has('acl','public').drop() <4>
g.V(v).properties('name').has('acl','public').value()
g.V(v).properties('name').has('acl','private').value()
g.V(v).properties()
g.V(v).properties().properties() <5>
g.V(v).properties().property('date',2014) <6>
g.V(v).properties().property('creator','stephen')
g.V(v).properties().properties()
g.V(v).properties('name').valueMap()
g.V(v).property('name','okram') <7>
g.V(v).properties('name')
g.V(v).values('name') <8>
----

<1> A vertex can have zero or more properties with the same key associated with it.
<2> If a property is added with a cardinality of `Cardinality.list`, an additional property with the provided key will be added.
<3> A vertex property can have standard key/value properties attached to it.
<4> Vertex property removal is identical to property removal.
<5> Gets the meta-properties of each vertex property.
<6> A vertex property can have any number of key/value properties attached to it.
<7> `property(...)` will remove all existing key'd properties before adding the new single property (see `VertexProperty.Cardinality`).
<8> If only the value of a property is needed, then `values()` can be used.

If the concept of vertex properties is difficult to grasp, then it may be best to think of vertex properties in terms
of "literal vertices." A vertex can have an edge to a "literal vertex" that has a single value key/value -- e.g.
"value=okram." The edge that points to that literal vertex has an edge-label of "name." The properties on the edge
represent the literal vertex's properties. The "literal vertex" can not have any other edges to it (only one from the
associated vertex).

TIP: A toy graph demonstrating all of the new TinkerPop graph structure features is available at
`TinkerFactory.createTheCrew()` and `data/tinkerpop-crew*`. This graph demonstrates multi-properties and meta-properties.

      select('a','b','c').by('name').by(value).by('startTime') // determine the current location of each person
g.V().has('name','gremlin').inE('uses').

      outV().as('b').
      select('a','b').by('skill').by('name') // rank the users of gremlin by their skill level

== Graph Variables

`Graph.Variables` are key/value pairs associated with the graph itself -- in essence, a `Map<String,Object>`. These
variables are intended to store metadata about the graph. Example use cases include:

 * *Schema information*: What do the namespace prefixes resolve to and when was the schema last modified?
 * *Global permissions*: What are the access rights for particular groups?
 * *System user information*: Who are the admins of the system?

An example of graph variables in use is presented below:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
graph.variables()
graph.variables().set('systemAdmins',['stephen','peter','pavel'])
graph.variables().set('systemUsers',['matthias','marko','josh'])
graph.variables().keys()
graph.variables().get('systemUsers')
graph.variables().get('systemUsers').get()
graph.variables().remove('systemAdmins')
graph.variables().keys()
----

IMPORTANT: Graph variables are not intended to be subject to heavy, concurrent mutation nor to be used in complex
computations. The intention is to have a location to store data about the graph for administrative purposes.

[[transactions]]
== Graph Transactions

image:gremlin-coins.png[width=100,float=right] A link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction[database transaction]
represents a unit of work to execute against the database.  Transactions are controlled by an implementation of the
`Transaction` interface and that object can be obtained from the `Graph` interface using the `tx()` method.  It is
important to note that the `Transaction` object does not represent a "transaction" itself.  It merely exposes the
methods for working with transactions (e.g. committing, rolling back, etc).

Most `Graph` implementations that `supportsTransactions` will implement an "automatic" `ThreadLocal` transaction,
which means that when a read or write occurs after the `Graph` is instantiated, a transaction is automatically
started within that thread.  There is no need to manually call a method to "create" or "start" a transaction.  Simply
modify the graph as required and call `graph.tx().commit()` to apply changes or `graph.tx().rollback()` to undo them.
When the next read or write action occurs against the graph, a new transaction will be started within that current
thread of execution.

When using transactions in this fashion, especially in web application (e.g. HTTP server), it is important to ensure
that transactions do not leak from one request to the next.  In other words, unless a client is somehow bound via
session to process every request on the same server thread, every request must be committed or rolled back at the end
of the request.  By ensuring that the request encapsulates a transaction, it ensures that a future request processed
on a server thread is starting in a fresh transactional state and will not have access to the remains of one from an
earlier request. A good strategy is to rollback a transaction at the start of a request, so that if it so happens that
a transactional leak does occur between requests somehow, a fresh transaction is assured by the fresh request.

TIP: The `tx()` method is on the `Graph` interface, but it is also available on the `TraversalSource` spawned from a
`Graph`.  Calls to `TraversalSource.tx()` are proxied through to the underlying `Graph` as a convenience.

WARNING: TinkerPop provides for basic transaction control, however, like many aspects of TinkerPop, it is up to the
graph system provider to choose the specific aspects of how their implementation will work and how it fits into the
TinkerPop stack. Be sure to understand the transaction semantics of the specific graph implementation that is being
utilized as it may present differing functionality than described here.

=== Configuring

Determining when a transaction starts is dependent upon the behavior assigned to the `Transaction`.  It is up to the
`Graph` implementation to determine the default behavior and unless the implementation doesn't allow it, the behavior
itself can be altered via these `Transaction` methods:

[source,java]
----
public Transaction onReadWrite(Consumer<Transaction> consumer);

public Transaction onClose(Consumer<Transaction> consumer);
----

Providing a `Consumer` function to `onReadWrite` allows definition of how a transaction starts when a read or a write
occurs. `Transaction.READ_WRITE_BEHAVIOR` contains pre-defined `Consumer` functions to supply to the `onReadWrite`
method.  It has two options:

* `AUTO` - automatic transactions where the transaction is started implicitly to the read or write operation
* `MANUAL` - manual transactions where it is up to the user to explicitly open a transaction, throwing an exception
if the transaction is not open

Providing a `Consumer` function to `onClose` allows configuration of how a transaction is handled when
`Transaction.close()` is called.  `Transaction.CLOSE_BEHAVIOR` has several pre-defined options that can be supplied to
this method:

* `COMMIT` - automatically commit an open transaction
* `ROLLBACK` - automatically rollback an open transaction
* `MANUAL` - throw an exception if a transaction is open, forcing the user to explicitly close the transaction

IMPORTANT: As transactions are `ThreadLocal` in nature, so are the transaction configurations for `onReadWrite` and
`onClose`.

Once there is an understanding for how transactions are configured, most of the rest of the `Transaction` interface
is self-explanatory. Note that <<neo4j-gremlin,Neo4j-Gremlin>> is used for the examples to follow as TinkerGraph does
not support transactions.

[source,groovy]
----
gremlin> graph = Neo4jGraph.open('/tmp/neo4j')
==>neo4jgraph[EmbeddedGraphDatabase [/tmp/neo4j]]
gremlin> g = graph.traversal()
==>graphtraversalsource[neo4jgraph[community single [/tmp/neo4j]], standard]
gremlin> graph.features()

>-- Computer: false
>-- Persistence: true
...
gremlin> g.tx().onReadWrite(Transaction.READ_WRITE_BEHAVIOR.AUTO) <2>
==>org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.neo4j.structure.Neo4jGraph$Neo4jTransaction@1c067c0d
gremlin> g.addV("person").("name","stephen")  <3>
==>v[0]
gremlin> g.tx().commit() <4>
==>null
gremlin> g.tx().onReadWrite(Transaction.READ_WRITE_BEHAVIOR.MANUAL) <5>
==>org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.neo4j.structure.Neo4jGraph$Neo4jTransaction@1c067c0d
gremlin> g.tx().isOpen()
==>false
gremlin> g.addV("person").("name","marko") <6>
Open a transaction before attempting to read/write the transaction
gremlin> g.tx().open() <7>
==>null
gremlin> g.addV("person").("name","marko") <8>
==>v[1]
gremlin> g.tx().commit()
==>null
----

<1> Check `features` to ensure that the graph supports transactions.
<2> By default, `Neo4jGraph` is configured with "automatic" transactions, so it is set here for demonstration purposes only.
<3> When the vertex is added, the transaction is automatically started.  From this point, more mutations can be staged
or other read operations executed in the context of that open transaction.
<4> Calling `commit` finalizes the transaction.
<5> Change transaction behavior to require manual control.
<6> Adding a vertex now results in failure because the transaction was not explicitly opened.
<7> Explicitly open a transaction.
<8> Adding a vertex now succeeds as the transaction was manually opened.

NOTE: It may be important to consult the documentation of the `Graph` implementation you are using when it comes to the
specifics of how transactions will behave.  TinkerPop allows some latitude in this area and implementations may not have
the exact same behaviors and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID[ACID] guarantees.

=== Threaded Transactions

Most `Graph` implementations that support transactions do so in a `ThreadLocal` manner, where the current transaction
is bound to the current thread of execution. Consider the following example to demonstrate:

[source,java]
----
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal();
g.addV("person").("name","stephen").iterate();

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    g.addV("person").("name","josh").iterate();
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
    g.addV("person").("name","marko").iterate();
});

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

g.tx().commit();
----

The above code shows three vertices added to `graph` in three different threads: the current thread, `t1` and
`t2`.  One might expect that by the time this body of code finished executing, that there would be three vertices
persisted to the `Graph`.  However, given the `ThreadLocal` nature of transactions, there really were three separate
transactions created in that body of code (i.e. one for each thread of execution) and the only one committed was the
first call to `addV()` in the primary thread of execution.  The other two calls to that method within `t1` and `t2`
were never committed and thus orphaned.

A `Graph` that `supportsThreadedTransactions` is one that allows for a `Graph` to operate outside of that constraint,
thus allowing multiple threads to operate within the same transaction.  Therefore, if there was a need to have three
different threads operating within the same transaction, the above code could be re-written as follows:

[source,java]
----
Graph threaded = graph.tx().createThreadedTx();
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal();
g.addV("person").("name","stephen").iterate();

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    threaded.addV("person").("name","josh").iterate();
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
    threaded.addV("person").("name","marko").iterate();
});

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

g.tx().commit();
----

In the above case, the call to `graph.tx().createThreadedTx()` creates a new `Graph` instance that is unbound from the
`ThreadLocal` transaction, thus allowing each thread to operate on it in the same context.  In this case, there would
be three separate vertices persisted to the `Graph`.

== Namespace Conventions

End users, <<implementations,graph system providers>>, <<graphcomputer,`GraphComputer`>> algorithm designers,
<<gremlin-plugins,GremlinPlugin>> creators, etc. all leverage properties on elements to store information. There are
a few conventions that should be respected when naming property keys to ensure that conflicts between these
stakeholders do not conflict.

* End users are granted the _flat namespace_ (e.g. `name`, `age`, `location`) to key their properties and label their elements.
* Graph system providers are granted the _hidden namespace_ (e.g. `~metadata`) to key their properties and labels.
Data keyed as such is only accessible via the graph system implementation and no other stakeholders are granted read
nor write access to data prefixed with "~" (see `Graph.Hidden`). Test coverage and exceptions exist to ensure that
graph systems respect this hard boundary.
* <<vertexprogram,`VertexProgram`>> and <<mapreduce,`MapReduce`>> developers should leverage _qualified namespaces_
particular to their domain (e.g. `mydomain.myvertexprogram.computedata`).
* `GremlinPlugin` creators should prefix their plugin name with their domain (e.g. `mydomain.myplugin`).

IMPORTANT: TinkerPop uses `tinkerpop.` and `gremlin.` as the prefixes for provided strategies, vertex programs, map
reduce implementations, and plugins.

The only truly protected namespace is the _hidden namespace_ provided to graph systems. From there, it's up to
engineers to respect the namespacing conventions presented.
