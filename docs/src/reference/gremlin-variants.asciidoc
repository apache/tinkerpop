Gremlin is a graph traversal language that makes use of two fundamental programming constructs:
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition[function composition] and
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_function[function nesting]. Given this generality, it is possible to embed
Gremlin in any modern programming language.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Java is the canonical representation of Gremlin and any (proper) Gremlin language variant will emulate its
structure as best as possible given the constructs of the host language. A strong correspondence between variants ensures
that the general Gremlin reference documentation is applicable to all variants and that users moving between development
languages can easily adopt the Gremlin variant for that language.

image::gremlin-variant-architecture.png[width=650,float=left]

NOTE: The information herein describes how to use the Gremlin language variants distributed
with Apache TinkerPop. For information on how to build a Gremlin language variant,
please review the link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/[Gremlin Language Variants]
tutorial.

[[gremlin-java]]
== Gremlin-Java

image:gremlin-java-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Java implements Gremlin within the Java8
language and can be used by any Java8 compliant virtual machine. Gremlin-Java is considered the canonical, reference
implementation of Gremlin and serves as the foundation by which all other Gremlin language variants should emulate.

=== The Lambda Solution

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is difficult as
most languages do not support lambda introspection and thus, code analysis. In Gremlin-Java, Java8 lambdas can be leveraged.

[source,java]
g.V().out("knows").map(t -> t.get().value("name") + " is the friend name") <1>
g.V().out("knows").sideEffect(System.out::println) <2>
g.V().as("a").out("knows").as("b").select("b").by((Function<Vertex, Integer>) v -> v.<String>value("name").length()) <3>

<1> A Java8 function is used to map a `Traverser<S>` to an object `E`.
<2> Gremlin steps that take consumer arguments can be passed Java8 method references.
<3> Gremlin-Java may sometimes require explicit lambda typing when types can not be automatically inferred.

When sending traversals over the wire via a `RemoteConnection`, the static methods of `Lambda` should be used
and should denote a particular JSR-223 `ScriptEngine`. `Lambda` creates a string-based lambda that is then converted
into a lambda/closure/anonymous-function/etc. by the respective lambda language's JSR-223 `ScriptEngine` implementation.

[source,java]
g.V().out("knows").map(Lambda.function("it.get().value('name') + ' is the friend name'"))
g.V().out("knows").sideEffect(Lambda.consumer("println it"))
g.V().as("a").out("knows").as("b").select("b").by(Lambda.<Vertex,Integer>function("it.value('name').length()"))

[[gremlin-groovy]]
== Gremlin-Groovy

image:gremlin-groovy-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Groovy implements Gremlin within the
link:http://groovy.apache.org[Apache Groovy] language. As a JVM-based language variant, Gremlin-Groovy is backed by
Gremlin-Java constructs. Moreover, given its scripting nature, Gremlin-Groovy serves as the language of
<<gremlin-console,Gremlin Console>>.

WARNING: In Groovy, `as`, `in`, and `not` are reserved words. Gremlin-Groovy does not allow these steps to be called
statically from the anonymous traversal `__` and therefore, must always be prefixed with `__.` For instance:
`g.V().as('a').in().as('b').where(__.not(__.as('a').out().as('b')))`

[[gremlin-python]]
== Gremlin-Python

image:gremlin-python-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Python implements Gremlin within
the link:https://www.python.org/[Python] language and can be used on any Python virtual machine including the popular
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython[CPython] machine. Python's syntax has the same constructs as Java including
"dot notation" for function chaining (`a.b.c`), round bracket function arguments (`a(b,c)`), and support for global
namespaces (`a(b())` vs `a(__.b())`). As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work
with Gremlin-Python. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin-Python that make traversals a bit more succinct.

WARNING: In Python, `as`, `in`, `and`, `or`, `is`, `not`, `from`, and `global` are reserved words. Gremlin-Python simply
postfixes `_` to the end of these terms for their use with graph traversal. For instance: `g.V().as_('a').in_().as_('b').select('a','b')`.

To install Gremlin-Python, use Python's link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)[pip] package manager.

[source,bash]
pip install gremlinpython

Gremlin-Python users will typically make use of the following classes.

[source,python]
>>> from gremlin_python import statics
>>> from gremlin_python.structure.graph import Graph
>>> from gremlin_python.process.graph_traversal import __
>>> from gremlin_python.process.strategies import *
>>> from gremlin_python.driver.driver_remote_connection import DriverRemoteConnection

In Gremlin-Python there exists `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__` which mirror the respective classes in Gremlin-Java.
The `GraphTraversalSource` requires a driver in order to communicate with <<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>> (or any
<<connecting-via-remotegraph,`RemoteConnection`>>-enabled server). The `gremlin_python.driver.driver_remote_connection`
is provided with Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Python distribution.

IMPORTANT: For developers wishing to provide another *driver implementation*, be sure to extend `RemoteConnection` in
`gremlin_python.driver` so it can then be used by Gremlin-Python's `GraphTraversal`.

When Gremlin Server is running, Gremlin-Python can communicate with Gremlin Server. The `conf/gremlin-server-modern-py.yaml`
configuration maintains a `GremlinJythonScriptEngine` as well as the appropriate serializers for communicating `Bytecode`.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Python is not compatible with GraphSON 1.0.

----

NOTE: The command to use `install` need only be executed once to gather `gremlin-python` dependencies into Gremlin Servers'
path. Future starts of Gremlin Server will not require that command.

Within the CPython console, an empty `Graph` is created and a traversal source is spawned with `RemoteStrategy`.

[source,python]
>>> graph = Graph()
>>> g = graph.traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin','g'))

When a traversal from the `GraphTraversalSource` is iterated, the traversal's `Bytecode` is sent over the wire
via the registered `RemoteConnection`. The bytecode is used to construct the equivalent traversal at the remote traversal source.
Moreover, typically the bytecode is analyzed to determine which language the bytecode should be translated to. If the traversal
does not contain lambdas, the remote location (e.g. Gremlin Server) will typically
use Gremlin-Java. If it has lambdas written in Groovy, it will use Gremlin-Groovy (e.g. `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine`).
Likewise, if it has lambdas represented in Python, it will use Gremlin-Python (e.g. `GremlinJythonScriptEngine`).

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Python's `Traversal` class supports the standard Gremlin methods such as `next()`, `nextTraverser()`,
`toSet()`, `toList()`, etc. Such "terminal" methods trigger the evaluation of the traversal.

=== RemoteConnection Submission

There are various ways to submit a traversal to a `RemoteConnection`. Just as in Gremlin-Java, there are various
"terminal/action methods" off of `Traversal`.

* `Traversal.next()`
* `Traversal.nextTraverser()`
* `Traversal.toList()`
* `Traversal.toSet()`
* `Traversal.iterate()`

=== Gremlin-Python Sugar

Python supports meta-programming and operator overloading. There are three uses of these techniques in Gremlin-Python that
makes traversals a bit more concise.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().both()[1:3].toList()
g.V().both()[1].toList()
g.V().both().name.toList()
----

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Operator`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin-Python as Python `Enums`.

[source,python]
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import T
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Order
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Cardinality
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Column
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Direction
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Operator
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import P
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Pop
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Scope
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Barrier

These can be used analogously to how they are used in Gremlin-Java.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',P.gt(30)).order().by('age',Order.desc).toList()
----

Moreover, by importing the `statics` of Gremlin-Python, the class prefixes can be omitted.

[source,python]
>>> statics.load_statics(globals())

With statics loaded its possible to represent the above traversal as below.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',gt(30)).order().by('age',desc).toList()
----

Finally, statics includes all the `__`-methods and thus, anonymous traversals like `__.out()` can be expressed as below.
That is, without the `__.`-prefix.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().repeat(out()).times(2).name.fold().toList()
----

=== Bindings

When a traversal bytecode is sent over a `RemoteConnection` (e.g. Gremlin Server), it will be translated, compiled, and then executed.
If the same traversal is sent again, translation and compilation can be skipped as the previously compiled version should be cached.
Many traversals are unique up to some parameterization. For instance, `g.V(1).out('created').name` is considered different
from `g.V(4).out('created').name'` as they have different script "string" representations. However, `g.V(x).out('created').name` with bindings of `{x : 1}` and
`{x : 4}` are considered the same. If a traversal is going to be executed repeatedly, but with different parameters, then bindings should be used.
In Gremlin-Python, bindings are 2-tuples and used as follows.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V(('id',1)).out('created').name.toList()
g.V(('id',4)).out('created').name.toList()
----

=== Traversal Strategies

In order to add and remove <<traversalstrategy,traversal strategies>> from a traversal source, Gremlin-Python has a
`TraversalStrategy` class along with a collection of subclasses that mirror the standard Gremlin-Java strategies.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g = g.withStrategies(SubgraphStrategy(vertices=hasLabel('person'),edges=has('weight',gt(0.5))))
g.V().name.toList()
g.V().outE().valueMap(True).toList()
g = g.withoutStrategies(SubgraphStrategy)
g.V().name.toList()
g.V().outE().valueMap(True).toList()
g = g.withComputer(workers=2,vertices=has('name','marko'))
g.V().name.toList()
g.V().outE().valueMap(True).toList()
----

NOTE: Many of the `TraversalStrategy` classes in Gremlin-Python are proxies to the respective strategy on
Apache TinkerPop's JVM-based Gremlin traversal machine. As such, their `apply(Traversal)` method does nothing. However,
the strategy is encoded in the Gremlin-Python bytecode and transmitted to the Gremlin traversal machine for
re-construction machine-side.

=== The Lambda Solution

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is difficult as
most languages do not support lambda introspection and thus, code analysis. In Gremlin-Python,
a link:https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#lambda[Python lambda] should be represented as a zero-arg callable
that returns a string representation of a lambda. The default lambda language is `gremlin-python` and can be changed via
`gremlin_python.statics.default_lambda_language`. When the lambda is represented in `Bytecode` its language is encoded
such that the remote connection host can infer which translator and ultimate execution engine to use.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().out().map(lambda: "lambda x: len(x.get().value('name'))").sum().toList()                     <1>
statics.default_lambda_language                                                                    <2>
g.V().out().map(lambda: ("it.get().value('name').length()", "gremlin-groovy")).sum().toList()      <3>
statics.default_lambda_language = 'gremlin-groovy'                                                 <4>
g.V().out().map(lambda: "it.get().value('name').length()").sum().toList()                          <5>
g.V().out().map(lambda: ("lambda x: len(x.get().value('name'))", "gremlin-python")).sum().toList() <6>
statics.default_lambda_language = 'gremlin-python'                                                 <7>
g.V().out().map(lambda: "x: len(x.get().value('name'))").sum().toList()                            <8>
----

<1> A zero-arg lambda yields a string representation of a lambda in Gremlin-Python.
<2> The default lambda language is currently Gremlin-Python.
<3> A zero-arg lambda yields a 2-tuple where the second element is the language of the lambda (Gremlin-Groovy).
<4> The default lambda language can be statically changed.
<5> A zero-arg lambda yields a string representation of a closure in Gremlin-Groovy.
<6> A zero-arg lambda yields a 2-tuple where the second element is the language of the lambda (Gremlin-Python).
<7> The default lambda language is changed back to Gremlin-Python.
<8> If the `lambda`-prefix is not provided, then it is appended automatically in order to give a more natural look to the expression.

=== Limitations

* Traversals that return a `Set` will be coerced to a `List` in Python so that traversals return consistent results
within a collection across different languages. In the case of Python, number equality is different from JVM languages
which produces different `Set` results when those types are in use. If a `Set` is needed then convert `List` results
to `Set` manually.

[[gremlin-DotNet]]
== Gremlin.Net

image:gremlin-dotnet-logo.png[width=371,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin.Net implements Gremlin within the C# language. It targets .NET Standard and can
therefore be used on different operating systems and with different .NET frameworks, such as .NET Framework
and link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/core[.NET Core]. Since the C# syntax is very similar to that of Java, it should be very easy to switch between
Gremlin-Java and Gremlin.Net. The only major syntactical difference is that all method names in Gremlin.Net
use PascalCase as opposed to camelCase in Gremlin-Java in order to comply with .NET conventions.

[source,powershell]
nuget install Gremlin.Net

In Gremlin.Net there exists `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__` which mirror the respective classes
in Gremlin-Java. The `GraphTraversalSource` requires a driver in order to communicate with <<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>> (or any
RemoteConnection-enabled server).

The `Gremlin.Net.Driver.Remote.DriverRemoteConnection` is provided as part of Apache TinkerPop’s Gremlin.Net.

IMPORTANT: For developers wishing to provide another driver implementation, be sure to implement `IRemoteConnection` in
`Gremlin.Net.Process.Remote` so it can then be used by Gremlin.Net’s `GraphTraversal`.

When Gremlin Server is running, Gremlin.Net can communicate with Gremlin Server by sending traversals serialized as `Bytecode`.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin.Net is not compatible with GraphSON 1.0.

A traversal source can be spawned with `RemoteStrategy` from an empty `Graph`.

[source,csharp]
----
var graph = new Graph();
var g = graph.Traversal().WithRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection(new GremlinClient(new GremlinServer("localhost", 8182))));
----

When a traversal from the `GraphTraversalSource` is iterated, the traversal’s `Bytecode` is sent over the wire via the registered
`IRemoteConnection`. The bytecode is used to construct the equivalent traversal at the remote traversal source.
Moreover, typically the bytecode is analyzed to determine which language the bytecode should be translated to. If the traversal
does not contain lambdas, the remote location (e.g. Gremlin Server) will typically
use Gremlin-Java. If it has lambdas written in Groovy, it will use Gremlin-Groovy (e.g. `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine`).
Likewise, if it has lambdas represented in Python, it will use Gremlin-Python (e.g. `GremlinJythonScriptEngine`).

IMPORTANT: Gremlin.Net’s `ITraversal` interface supports the standard Gremlin methods such as `Next()`, `NextTraverser()`, `ToSet()`,
`ToList()`, etc. Such "terminal" methods trigger the evaluation of the traversal.

=== RemoteConnection Submission

Very similar to Gremlin-Python and Gremlin-Java, there are various ways to submit a traversal to a `IRemoteConnection` using
terminal/action methods off of `ITraversal`.

* `ITraversal.Next()`
* `ITraversal.NextTraverser()`
* `ITraversal.ToList()`
* `ITraversal.ToSet()`
* `ITraversal.Iterate()`

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Operator`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin.Net as classes.

These can be used analogously to how they are used in Gremlin-Java.

[source,csharp]
g.V().HasLabel("person").Has("age",P.Gt(30)).Order().By("age",Order.desc).ToList()

Moreover, the class prefixes can be omitted with a `using static`.

[source,csharp]
----
using static Gremlin.Net.Process.Traversal.P;
using static Gremlin.Net.Process.Traversal.Order;
----

Then it is possible to represent the above traversal as below.

[source,csharp]
g.V().HasLabel("person").Has("age",Gt(30)).Order().By("age",desc).ToList()

Finally, with using static `__`, anonymous traversals like `__.Out()` can be expressed as below. That is, without the `__.`-prefix.

[source,csharp]
g.V().Repeat(Out()).Times(2).Values("name").Fold().ToList()

=== Bindings

When a traversal bytecode is sent over a `IRemoteConnection` (e.g. Gremlin Server), it will be translated, compiled,
and then executed. If the same traversal is sent again, translation and compilation can be skipped as the previously
compiled version should be cached. Many traversals are unique up to some parameterization. For instance,
`g.V(1).Out("created").Values("name")` is considered different from `g.V(4).Out("created").Values("Name")`
as they have different script "string" representations. However, `g.V(x).Out("created").Values("name")` with bindings of 
`{x : 1}` and `{x : 4}` are considered the same. If a traversal is going to be executed repeatedly, but with different 
parameters, then bindings should be used. In Gremlin.Net, bindings are objects that can be created as follows.

[source,csharp]
----
var b = new Bindings();
g.V(b.Of("id", 1)).Out("created").Values("name").toList()
g.V(b.Of("id", 4)).Out("created").Values("name").toList()
----

=== Traversal Strategies

In order to add and remove traversal strategies from a traversal source, Gremlin.Net has an `AbstractTraversalStrategy`
class along with a collection of subclasses that mirror the standard Gremlin-Java strategies.

[source,csharp]
----
g = g.WithStrategies(new SubgraphStrategy(vertexCriterion: HasLabel("person"),
    edgeCriterion: Has("weight", Gt(0.5))));
var names = g.V().Values("name").ToList();  // names: [marko, vadas, josh, peter]

g = g.WithoutStrategies(typeof(SubgraphStrategy));
names = g.V().Values("name").ToList(); // names: [marko, vadas, lop, josh, ripple, peter]

var edgeValueMaps = g.V().OutE().ValueMap(true).ToList();
// edgeValueMaps: [[label:created, id:9, weight:0.4], [label:knows, id:7, weight:0.5], [label:knows, id:8, weight:1.0],
//     [label:created, id:10, weight:1.0], [label:created, id:11, weight:0.4], [label:created, id:12, weight:0.2]]

g = g.WithComputer(workers: 2, vertices: Has("name", "marko"));
names = g.V().Values("name").ToList();  // names: [marko]

edgeValueMaps = g.V().OutE().ValueMap(true).ToList();
// edgeValueMaps: [[label:created, id:9, weight:0.4], [label:knows, id:7, weight:0.5], [label:knows, id:8, weight:1.0]]
----

NOTE: Many of the TraversalStrategy classes in Gremlin.Net are proxies to the respective strategy on Apache TinkerPop’s
JVM-based Gremlin traversal machine. As such, their `Apply(ITraversal)` method does nothing. However, the strategy is
encoded in the Gremlin.Net bytecode and transmitted to the Gremlin traversal machine for re-construction machine-side.

=== The Lambda Solution

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is difficult as
most languages do not support lambda introspection and thus, code analysis. While Gremlin.Net doesn't support C# lambdas, it
is still able to represent lambdas in other languages. When the lambda is represented in `Bytecode` its language is encoded
such that the remote connection host can infer which translator and ultimate execution engine to use.

[source,csharp]
----
g.V().Out().Map<int>(Lambda.Groovy("it.get().value('name').length()")).Sum<int>().ToList();      <1>
g.V().Out().Map<int>(Lambda.Python("lambda x: len(x.get().value('name'))")).Sum<int>().ToList(); <2>
----

<1> `Lambda.Groovy()` can be used to create a Groovy lambda. 
<2> `Lambda.Python()` can be used to create a Python lambda.

The `ILambda` interface returned by these two methods inherits interfaces like `IFunction` and `IPredicate` that mirror
their Java counterparts which makes it possible to use lambdas with Gremlin.Net for the same steps as in Gremlin-Java.

[[gremlin-javascript]]
== Gremlin-JavaScript

image:gremlin-js.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-JavaScript implements Gremlin within the
JavaScript language. It targets Node.js runtime and can be used on different operating systems on any Node.js 6 or
above. Since the JavaScript naming conventions are very similar to that of Java, it should be very easy to switch
between Gremlin-Java and Gremlin-JavaScript.

[source,bash]
npm install gremlin

The Gremlin-JavaScript provides `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__` which mirror the respective classes
in Gremlin-Java. The `GraphTraversalSource` requires a RemoteConnection implementation in order to communicate with
<<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>>.

[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const Graph = gremlin.structure.Graph;
const DriverRemoteConnection = gremlin.driver.DriverRemoteConnection;
----

A traversal source can be spawned with `RemoteStrategy` from an empty `Graph`.

[source,javascript]
----
const graph = new Graph();
const g = graph.traversal().withRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin'));
----

When a traversal from the `GraphTraversalSource` is iterated, the traversal’s `Bytecode` is sent over the wire via
the registered `RemoteConnection`. The bytecode is used to construct the equivalent traversal at the remote
traversal source.

Since Gremlin-JavaScript currently doesn't support lambda expressions, all traversals can be translated to
Gremlin-Java on the remote location (e.g. Gremlin Server).

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-JavaScript’s `Traversal` base class supports the standard Gremlin methods such as `next()` and
`toList()` Such "terminal" methods trigger the evaluation of the traversal.

=== RemoteConnection Submission

In a similar way as in other GLVs, there are various ways to submit a traversal to a
`RemoteConnection` using terminal/action methods off of `Traversal`. Given that I/O operations in Node.js are
asynchronous by default, this terminal methods return a `Promise`.

* `Traversal.toList()`: Returns a `Promise` with an `Array` as result value.
* `Traversal.next()`: Returns a `Promise` with a `{ value, done }` tuple as result value, according to the
link:https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration[async iterator proposal].
* `Traversal.iterate()`: Returns a `Promise` without a value.


For example:

[source,javascript]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList()
  .then(names => console.log(names));
----

You can `await` the promises if you are using `async` functions.

[source,javascript]
----
const names = await g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList();
console.log(names);
----

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `t`, `P`, `order`, `direction`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin-JavaScript as
objects.

[source,javascript]
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age', P.gt(30)).order().by('age', order.desc).toList()

These objects must be required manually from the `process` namespace:

[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const P = gremlin.process.P;
----

Finally, using static `__` anonymous traversals like `__.out()` can be expressed as below:

[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const __ = gremlin.process.statics;

g.V().repeat(__.out()).times(2).values("name").fold().toList();
----
