= Gremlin Drivers and Variants

image::gremlin-house-of-mirrors.png[width=1024]

The <<connecting-gremlin,Connecting Gremlin>> Section described the different ways in which a developer can use
Gremlin in their applications. Two of those methods <<connecting-gremlin-server,Gremlin Server>> and
<<connecting-rgp,Remote Gremlin Providers>> placed the Traversal Machine on a remote system separate from the client.
It is in these cases that developers must select a driver to utilize Gremlin.

TinkerPop provides and array of drivers in different programming languages as a way to connect to a remote Gremlin
Server or Remote Gremlin Provider. Drivers allow the developer to make requests to that remote system and get back
results from the TinkerPop-enabled graphs hosted within. A driver can submit Gremlin strings and Gremlin bytecode
over this subprotocol. Gremlin strings are written in the scripting language made available by the remote system that
the driver is connecting to (typically, Groovy-based). This connection approach is quite similar to what developers
are likely familiar with when using JDBC and SQL. While it is familiar, it is not recommended and for TinkerPop it is
considered an out-dated concept and is largely still present to support applications that might still be using that
method of interaction.

The preferred approach is to use bytecode based requests, which essentially allows the ability to craft Gremlin
directly in the programming language of choice. As Gremlin makes use of two fundamental programming constructs:
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition[function composition] and
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_function[function nesting]. it is possible to embed the Gremlin language
in any modern programming language.It is a far more natural way to program, because it enables IDE interaction,
compile time checks, and language level checks that can help prevent errors prior to execution. The differences
between these two approaches were outlined in the <<connecting-via-drivers,Connecting Via Drivers>> Section.

TinkerPop natively supports drivers and variants of Gremlin in a number of different programming languages. They are
all described in the following sections. There are also third-party implementations of drivers and Gremlin, as well
as extensions to the Gremlin language that might be specific to a particular graph provider. That listing can be
found on the TinkerPop link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/#graph-systems[home page]. Their description is beyond the
scope of this documentation.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Java is the canonical representation of Gremlin and any (proper) Gremlin language variant will
emulate its structure as best as possible given the constructs of the host language. A strong correspondence between
variants ensures that the general Gremlin reference documentation is applicable to all variants and that users moving
between development languages can easily adopt the Gremlin variant for that language.

NOTE: The information herein describes how to use the Gremlin language variants distributed
with Apache TinkerPop. For information on how to build a Gremlin language variant, please review the

== Gremlin-Java

image:gremlin-java-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Java implements Gremlin within the
Java language and can be used by any Java Virtual Machine. Gremlin-Java is considered the canonical, reference
implementation of Gremlin and serves as the foundation by which all other Gremlin language variants should emulate.
As the Traversal Machine that processes Gremlin queries is also written in Java, it can be used in all three connection
methods described in the <<connecting-gremlin,Connecting Gremlin>> Section.

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Direction`, etc.) that in most examples are short-handed by way
of static imports. To get this same short-handed effect, the typical list of imports that users should have when
utilizing Gremlin Java are:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.dsl.graph.GraphTraversalSource;
import org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.Bindings;
import org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.IO;
import static org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.Operator.*;

import static org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.T.*;
import static org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.dsl.graph.__.*;

=== Connecting

The pattern for connecting is described in <<connecting-gremlin,Connecting Gremlin>> and it basically distills down to
creating a `Graph` instance and then spawning a `GraphTraversalSource`.

[source,java]
----
Graph graph = ...;
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal();
----

Using "g" it is then possible to start writing Gremlin. The "g" allows for the setting of many configuration options
which affect traversal execution. The <<traversal, Traversal>> Section describes some of these options and some are
only suitable with <<connecting-embedded,embedded>> style usage. For remote options however there are some added
setup and configurations to consider and this section looks to address those.

The most basic way to connect to <<connecting-gremlin-server,Gremlin Server>> or
<<connecting-rgp,Remote Gremlin Providers>> uses the following two lines of code:

[source,java]
----
Graph graph = EmptyGraph.instance();
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal().withRemote('conf/remote-graph.properties');
----

The `remote-graph.properties` file simply provides connection information to the `GraphTraversalSource` which is used
to configure a `RemoteConnection`. That file looks like this:

[source,text]
----
gremlin.remote.remoteConnectionClass=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.driver.remote.DriverRemoteConnection
gremlin.remote.driver.clusterFile=conf/remote-objects.yaml
gremlin.remote.driver.sourceName=g
----

The `RemoteConnection` is an interface that provides the transport mechanism for "g" and makes it possible to for
that mechanism to be altered (typically by graph providers who have their own protocols). TinkerPop provides one such
implementation called the `DriverRemoteConnection` which enables transport over Gremlin Server protocols using the
TinkerPop driver. The driver is configured by the specified `gremlin.remote.driver.clusterFile` and the local "g" is
bound to the `GraphTraversalSource` on the remote end with `gremlin.remote.driver.sourceName` which in this case is
also "g".

There are other ways to configure the traversal using `withRemote()` as it has other overloads. It can also take an
Apache Commons `Configuration` object which would have keys similar to those shown in the properties file and it
can also take a `RemoteConnection` instance directly. The latter is interesting in that it means it is possible to
programmatically construct all aspects of the `RemoteConnection`. For TinkerPop usage, that might mean directly
constructing the `DriverRemoteConnection` and the driver instance that supplies the transport mechanism. For example,
the command shown above could be re-written using programmatic construction as follows:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.open();
Graph graph = EmptyGraph.instance();
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection.using(cluster, "g"));
----

Please consider the following example:

[gremlin-groovy]
----
graph = EmptyGraph.instance()
g = graph.traversal().withRemote('conf/remote-graph.properties')
g.V().valueMap(true)
g.close()
----
[java]
----
Graph graph = EmptyGraph.instance();
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal().withRemote("conf/remote-graph.properties");
List<Map> list = g.V().valueMap(true);
g.close()
----

Note the call to `close()` above. The call to `withRemote()` internally instantiates a connection via the driver that
can only be released by "closing" the `GraphTraversalSource`. It is important to take that step to release resources
created in that step.

If working with multiple remote `TraversalSource` instances it is more efficient to construct a `Cluster` object and
then re-use it.

[gremlin-groovy]
----
cluster = Cluster.open('conf/remote-objects.yaml')
graph = EmptyGraph.instance()
g = graph.traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection.using(cluster, "g"))
g.V().valueMap(true)
g.close()
cluster.close()
----

If the `Cluster` instance is supplied externally, as is shown above, then it is not closed implicitly by the close of
"g".  Closing "g" will only close the connection associated with that `TraversalSource`. In this case, the
`Cluster` must also be closed explicitly. Closing "g" and the "cluster" aren't actually both necessary - the close of
a `Cluster` will close all connections spawned by the `Cluster`.

IMPORTANT: Bytecode-based traversals use the `TraversalOpProcessor` in Gremlin Server which requires a cache to enable
the retrieval of side-effects (if the `Traversal` produces any). That cache can be configured (e.g. controlling
eviction times and sizing) in the Gremlin Server configuration file as described <<traversalopprocessor, here>>.

=== Configuration

=== Serialization

Serialization applies when using the driver to submit Gremlin to a remote system in some way. TinkerPop has two
options for serialization built into it for JVM-based languages: Gryo and GraphSON. When using Gryo serialization
(the default serializer for the Java driver), it is important that the client and server have the same serializers
configured or else one or the other will experience serialization exceptions and fail to always communicate.
Discrepancy in serializer registration between client and server can happen fairly easily as graphs will automatically
include serializers on the server-side, thus leaving the client to be configured manually. This can be done manually
as follows:

[source,java]
----
IoRegistry registry = ...; // an IoRegistry instance exposed by a specific graph provider
GryoMapper kryo = GryoMapper.build().addRegistry(registry).create();
MessageSerializer serializer = new GryoMessageSerializerV3d0(kryo);
Cluster cluster = Cluster.build().
                          serializer(serializer).
                          create();
Graph graph = EmptyGraph.instance();
GraphTraversalSource g = graph.traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection.using(cluster, "g"));
----

The `IoRegistry` tells the serializer what classes from the graph provider to auto-register during serialization.
Gremlin Server roughly uses this same approach when it configures it's serializers, so using this same model will
ensure compatibility when making requests. Obviously, it is possible to switch to GraphSON by building a
`GraphSONMessageSerializerV3d0` in the same way and building that into the `Cluster` object

=== The Lambda Solution

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is difficult as
most languages do not support lambda introspection and thus, code analysis. In Gremlin-Java and with
<<connecting-embedded,embedded>> usage, lambdas can be leveraged directly:

[source,java]
g.V().out("knows").map(t -> t.get().value("name") + " is the friend name") <1>
g.V().out("knows").sideEffect(System.out::println) <2>
g.V().as("a").out("knows").as("b").select("b").by((Function<Vertex, Integer>) v -> v.<String>value("name").length()) <3>

<1> A Java `Function` is used to map a `Traverser<S>` to an object `E`.
<2> Gremlin steps that take consumer arguments can be passed Java method references.
<3> Gremlin-Java may sometimes require explicit lambda typing when types can not be automatically inferred.

When sending traversals remotely to <<connecting-gremlin-server,Gremlin Server>> or
<<connecting-rgp,Remote Gremlin Providers>>, the static methods of `Lambda` should be used and should denote a
particular JSR-223 `ScriptEngine`. `Lambda` creates a string-based lambda that is then converted into a
lambda/closure/anonymous-function/etc. by the respective lambda language's JSR-223 `ScriptEngine` implementation.

[source,java]
g.V().out("knows").map(Lambda.function("it.get().value('name') + ' is the friend name'"))
g.V().out("knows").sideEffect(Lambda.consumer("println it"))
g.V().as("a").out("knows").as("b").select("b").by(Lambda.<Vertex,Integer>function("it.value('name').length()"))

Finally, Gremlin `Bytecode` that includes lambdas requires that the traversal be processed by the
`GremlinScriptEngine`. To avoid continued recompilation costs, it supports the encoding of bindings,
which allow Gremlin Server to cache traversals that will be reused over and over again save that some
parameterization may change. Thus, instead of translating, compiling, and then executing each submitted bytecode,
it is possible to simply execute. To express bindings in Java, use `Bindings`.

[source,java]
----
b = Bindings.instance()
g.V(b.of('id',1)).out('created').values('name').map{t -> "name: " + t.get() }
g.V(b.of('id',4)).out('created').values('name').map{t -> "name: " + t.get() }
g.V(b.of('id',4)).out('created').values('name').getBytecode()
g.V(b.of('id',4)).out('created').values('name').getBytecode().getBindings()
cluster.close()
----

Both traversals are abstractly defined as `g.V(id).out('created').values('name')` and thus, the first submission
can be cached for faster evaluation on the next submission.

WARNING: It is generally advised to avoid lambda usage. Please consider <<a-note-on-lambdas,A Note On Lambdas>> for
more information.

=== Submitting Scripts

WARNING: TinkerPop does not recommend submitting script-based requests and generally continues to support this feature
for legacy reasons and corner use cases which are still not completely addressed by the Gremlin language. Please
consider using bytecode-based requests instead when possible.

image:gremlin-java.png[width=175,float=left] TinkerPop comes equipped with a reference client for Java-based
applications.  It is referred to as Gremlin Driver, which enables applications to send requests to Gremlin Server
and get back results.

Gremlin code is sent to the server from a `Client` instance.  A `Client` is created as follows:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.open();  <1>
Client client = cluster.connect(); <2>
----

<1> Opens a reference to `localhost` - note that there are many configuration options available in defining a `Cluster` object.
<2> Creates a `Client` given the configuration options of the `Cluster`.

Once a `Client` instance is ready, it is possible to issue some Gremlin:

[source,java]
----
ResultSet results = client.submit("[1,2,3,4]");  <1>
results.stream().map(i -> i.get(Integer.class) * 2);       <2>

CompletableFuture<List<Result>> results = client.submit("[1,2,3,4]").all();  <3>

CompletableFuture<ResultSet> future = client.submitAsync("[1,2,3,4]"); <4>

Map<String,Object> params = new HashMap<>();
params.put("x",4);
client.submit("[1,2,3,x]", params); <5>
----

<1> Submits a script that simply returns a `List` of integers.  This method blocks until the request is written to
the server and a `ResultSet` is constructed.
<2> Even though the `ResultSet` is constructed, it does not mean that the server has sent back the results (or even
evaluated the script potentially).  The `ResultSet` is just a holder that is awaiting the results from the server.
In this case, they are streamed from the server as they arrive.
<3> Submit a script, get a `ResultSet`, then return a `CompletableFuture` that will be called when all results have been returned.
<4> Submit a script asynchronously without waiting for the request to be written to the server.
<5> Parameterized request are considered the most efficient way to send Gremlin to the server as they can be cached,
which will boost performance and reduce resources required on the server.

==== Per Request Settings

There are a number of overloads to `Client.submit()` that accept a `RequestOptions` object. The `RequestOptions`
provide a way to include options that are specific to the request made with the call to `submit()`. A good use-case for
this feature is to set a per-request override to the `scriptEvaluationTimeout` so that it only applies to the current
request.

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.open();
Client client = cluster.connect();
RequestOptions options = RequestOptions.build().timeout(500).create();
List<Result> result = client.submit("g.V()", options).all().get();
----

==== Aliases

Scripts submitted to Gremlin Server automatically have the globally configured `Graph` and `TraversalSource` instances
made available to them.  Therefore, if Gremlin Server configures two `TraversalSource` instances called "g1" and "g2"
a script can simply reference them directly as:

[source,java]
client.submit("g1.V()")
client.submit("g2.V()")

While this is an acceptable way to submit scripts, it has the downside of forcing the client to encode the server-side
variable name directly into the script being sent.  If the server configuration ever changed such that "g1" became
"g100", the client-side code might have to see a significant amount of change.  Decoupling the script code from the
server configuration can be managed by the `alias` method on `Client` as follows:

[source,java]
Client g1Client = client.alias("g1")
Client g2Client = client.alias("g2")
g1Client.submit("g.V()")
g2Client.submit("g.V()")

The above code demonstrates how the `alias` method can be used such that the script need only contain a reference
to "g" and "g1" and "g2" are automatically rebound into "g" on the server-side.

[[gremlin-groovy]]
== Gremlin-Groovy

image:gremlin-groovy-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Groovy implements Gremlin within the
link:http://groovy.apache.org[Apache Groovy] language. As a JVM-based language variant, Gremlin-Groovy is backed by
Gremlin-Java constructs. Moreover, given its scripting nature, Gremlin-Groovy serves as the language of
<<gremlin-console,Gremlin Console>>.

WARNING: In Groovy, `as`, `in`, and `not` are reserved words. Gremlin-Groovy does not allow these steps to be called
statically from the anonymous traversal `__` and therefore, must always be prefixed with `__.` For instance:
`g.V().as('a').in().as('b').where(__.not(__.as('a').out().as('b')))`

[[gremlin-python]]
== Gremlin-Python

image:gremlin-python-drawing.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Python implements Gremlin within
the link:https://www.python.org/[Python] language and can be used on any Python virtual machine including the popular
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython[CPython] machine. Python's syntax has the same constructs as Java including
"dot notation" for function chaining (`a.b.c`), round bracket function arguments (`a(b,c)`), and support for global
namespaces (`a(b())` vs `a(__.b())`). As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work
with Gremlin-Python. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin-Python that make traversals a bit more succinct.

WARNING: In Python, `and`, `as`, `from`, `global`, `in`, `is`, `not`, and `or` are reserved words. Gremlin-Python simply
postfixes `_` to the end of these terms for their use with graph traversal. For instance: `g.V().as_('a').in_().as_('b').select('a','b')`.

To install Gremlin-Python, use Python's link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)[pip] package manager.

[source,bash]
pip install gremlinpython

Gremlin-Python users will typically make use of the following classes.

[source,python]
>>> from gremlin_python import statics
>>> from gremlin_python.process.anonymous_traversal_source import traversal
>>> from gremlin_python.process.graph_traversal import __
>>> from gremlin_python.process.strategies import *
>>> from gremlin_python.driver.driver_remote_connection import DriverRemoteConnection

In Gremlin-Python there exists `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__` which mirror the respective classes in Gremlin-Java.
The `GraphTraversalSource` requires a driver in order to communicate with <<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>> (or any
<<connecting-via-remotegraph,`RemoteConnection`>>-enabled server). The `gremlin_python.driver.driver_remote_connection`
is provided with Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-Python distribution.

IMPORTANT: For developers wishing to provide another *driver implementation*, be sure to extend `RemoteConnection` in
`gremlin_python.driver` so it can then be used by Gremlin-Python's `GraphTraversal`.

When Gremlin Server is running, Gremlin-Python can communicate with Gremlin Server. The `conf/gremlin-server-modern-py.yaml`
configuration maintains a `GremlinJythonScriptEngine` as well as the appropriate serializers for communicating `Bytecode`.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Python is not compatible with GraphSON 1.0.

----

NOTE: The command to use `install` need only be executed once to gather `gremlin-python` dependencies into Gremlin Servers'
path. Future starts of Gremlin Server will not require that command.

Within CPython console, a `GraphTraversalSource` is created from the anonymous `traversal()` method where the "g"
provided to the `DriverRemoteConnection` corresponds to the name of a `GraphTraversalSource` on the remote end.

[source,python]
>>> g = traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin','g'))

When a traversal from the `GraphTraversalSource` is iterated, the traversal's `Bytecode` is sent over the wire
via the registered `RemoteConnection`. The bytecode is used to construct the equivalent traversal at the remote traversal source.
Moreover, typically the bytecode is analyzed to determine which language the bytecode should be translated to. If the traversal
does not contain lambdas, the remote location (e.g. Gremlin Server) will typically
use Gremlin-Java. If it has lambdas written in Groovy, it will use Gremlin-Groovy (e.g. `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine`).
Likewise, if it has lambdas represented in Python, it will use Gremlin-Python (e.g. `GremlinJythonScriptEngine`).

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-Python's `Traversal` class supports the standard Gremlin methods such as `next()`, `nextTraverser()`,
`toSet()`, `toList()`, etc. Such "terminal" methods trigger the evaluation of the traversal.

==== Configuration

The following table describes the various configuration options for the Gremlin-Python Driver. They
can be passed to the `Client` or `DriverRemoteConnection` instance as keyword arguments:

[width="100%",cols="3,10,^2",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Key |Description |Default
|protocol_factory |A callable that returns an instance of `AbstractBaseProtocol`. |`gremlin_python.driver.protocol.GremlinServerWSProtocol`
|transport_factory |A callable that returns an instance of `AbstractBaseTransport`. |`gremlin_python.driver.tornado.transport.TornadoTransport`
|pool_size |The number of connections used by the pool. |4
|max_workers |Maximum number of worker threads. |Number of CPUs * 5
|message_serializer |The message serializer implementation.|`gremlin_python.driver.serializer.GraphSONMessageSerializer`
|password |The password to submit on requests that require authentication. |""
|username |The username to submit on requests that require authentication. |""
|=========================================================

=== RemoteConnection Submission

There are various ways to submit a traversal to a `RemoteConnection`. Just as in Gremlin-Java, there are various
"terminal/action methods" off of `Traversal`.

* `Traversal.next()`
* `Traversal.nextTraverser()`
* `Traversal.toList()`
* `Traversal.toSet()`
* `Traversal.iterate()`

=== Gremlin-Python Sugar

Python supports meta-programming and operator overloading. There are three uses of these techniques in Gremlin-Python that
makes traversals a bit more concise.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().both()[1:3].toList()
g.V().both()[1].toList()
g.V().both().name.toList()
----

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Operator`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin-Python as Python `Enums`.

[source,python]
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import T
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Order
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Cardinality
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Column
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Direction
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Operator
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import P
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Pop
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Scope
>>> from gremlin_python.process.traversal import Barrier

These can be used analogously to how they are used in Gremlin-Java.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',P.gt(30)).order().by('age',Order.desc).toList()
----

Moreover, by importing the `statics` of Gremlin-Python, the class prefixes can be omitted.

[source,python]
>>> statics.load_statics(globals())

With statics loaded its possible to represent the above traversal as below.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age',gt(30)).order().by('age',desc).toList()
----

Finally, statics includes all the `__`-methods and thus, anonymous traversals like `__.out()` can be expressed as below.
That is, without the `__.`-prefix.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().repeat(out()).times(2).name.fold().toList()
----

=== Bindings

When a traversal bytecode is sent over a `RemoteConnection` (e.g. Gremlin Server), it will be translated, compiled, and then executed.
If the same traversal is sent again, translation and compilation can be skipped as the previously compiled version should be cached.
Many traversals are unique up to some parameterization. For instance, `g.V(1).out('created').name` is considered different
from `g.V(4).out('created').name'` as they have different script "string" representations. However, `g.V(x).out('created').name` with bindings of `{x : 1}` and
`{x : 4}` are considered the same. If a traversal is going to be executed repeatedly, but with different parameters, then bindings should be used.
In Gremlin-Python, bindings are 2-tuples and used as follows.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V(('id',1)).out('created').name.toList()
g.V(('id',4)).out('created').name.toList()
----

=== Traversal Strategies

In order to add and remove <<traversalstrategy,traversal strategies>> from a traversal source, Gremlin-Python has a
`TraversalStrategy` class along with a collection of subclasses that mirror the standard Gremlin-Java strategies.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g = g.withStrategies(SubgraphStrategy(vertices=hasLabel('person'),edges=has('weight',gt(0.5))))
g.V().name.toList()
g.V().outE().valueMap().with_(WithOptions.tokens).toList()
g = g.withoutStrategies(SubgraphStrategy)
g.V().name.toList()
g.V().outE().valueMap().with_(WithOptions.tokens).toList()
g = g.withComputer(workers=2,vertices=has('name','marko'))
g.V().name.toList()
g.V().outE().valueMap().with_(WithOptions.tokens).toList()
----

NOTE: Many of the `TraversalStrategy` classes in Gremlin-Python are proxies to the respective strategy on
Apache TinkerPop's JVM-based Gremlin traversal machine. As such, their `apply(Traversal)` method does nothing. However,
the strategy is encoded in the Gremlin-Python bytecode and transmitted to the Gremlin traversal machine for
re-construction machine-side.

=== The Lambda Solution

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is difficult as
most languages do not support lambda introspection and thus, code analysis. In Gremlin-Python,
a link:https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#lambda[Python lambda] should be represented as a zero-arg callable
that returns a string representation of a lambda. The default lambda language is `gremlin-python` and can be changed via
`gremlin_python.statics.default_lambda_language`. When the lambda is represented in `Bytecode` its language is encoded
such that the remote connection host can infer which translator and ultimate execution engine to use.

[gremlin-python,modern]
----
g.V().out().map(lambda: "lambda x: len(x.get().value('name'))").sum().toList()                     <1>
statics.default_lambda_language                                                                    <2>
g.V().out().map(lambda: ("it.get().value('name').length()", "gremlin-groovy")).sum().toList()      <3>
statics.default_lambda_language = 'gremlin-groovy'                                                 <4>
g.V().out().map(lambda: "it.get().value('name').length()").sum().toList()                          <5>
g.V().out().map(lambda: ("lambda x: len(x.get().value('name'))", "gremlin-python")).sum().toList() <6>
statics.default_lambda_language = 'gremlin-python'                                                 <7>
g.V().out().map(lambda: "x: len(x.get().value('name'))").sum().toList()                            <8>
----

<1> A zero-arg lambda yields a string representation of a lambda in Gremlin-Python.
<2> The default lambda language is currently Gremlin-Python.
<3> A zero-arg lambda yields a 2-tuple where the second element is the language of the lambda (Gremlin-Groovy).
<4> The default lambda language can be statically changed.
<5> A zero-arg lambda yields a string representation of a closure in Gremlin-Groovy.
<6> A zero-arg lambda yields a 2-tuple where the second element is the language of the lambda (Gremlin-Python).
<7> The default lambda language is changed back to Gremlin-Python.
<8> If the `lambda`-prefix is not provided, then it is appended automatically in order to give a more natural look to the expression.

=== Limitations

* Traversals that return a `Set` *might* be coerced to a `List` in Python. In the case of Python, number equality 
is different from JVM languages which produces different `Set` results when those types are in use. When this case
is detected during deserialization, the `Set` is coerced to a `List` so that traversals return consistent
results within a collection across different languages. If a `Set` is needed then convert `List` results
to `Set` manually.
* Gremlin is capable of returning Dictionary results that use non-hashable keys (e.g. Dictionary as a key) and Python
does not support that at a language level. Gremlin that returns such results will need to be re-written to avoid that.

=== Submitting Scripts

WARNING: TinkerPop does not recommend submitting script-based requests and generally continues to support this feature
for legacy reasons and corner use cases which are still not completely addressed by the Gremlin language. Please
consider using bytecode-based requests instead when possible.

The `Client` class implementation/interface is based on the Java Driver, with some restrictions. Most notably,
Gremlin-Python does not yet implement the `Cluster` class. Instead, `Client` is instantiated directly.
Usage is as follows:

[source,python]
----
from gremlin_python.driver import client <1>
client = client.Client('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin', 'g') <2>
----

<1> Import the Gremlin-Python `client` module.
<2> Opens a reference to `localhost` - note that there are various configuration options that can be passed
to the `Client` object upon instantiation as keyword arguments.

Once a `Client` instance is ready, it is possible to issue some Gremlin:

[source,python]
----
result_set = client.submit("[1,2,3,4]")  <1>
future_results = result_set.all()  <2>
results = future_results.result() <3>
assert results == [1, 2, 3, 4] <4>

future_result_set = client.submitAsync("[1,2,3,4]") <5>
result_set = future_result_set.result() <6>
result = result_set.one() <7>
assert results == [1, 2, 3, 4] <8>
assert result_set.done.done() <9>

client.close() <10>
----

<1> Submit a script that simply returns a `List` of integers.  This method blocks until the request is written to
the server and a `ResultSet` is constructed.
<2> Even though the `ResultSet` is constructed, it does not mean that the server has sent back the results (or even
evaluated the script potentially).  The `ResultSet` is just a holder that is awaiting the results from the server. The `all` method
returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` that resolves to a list when it is complete.
<3> Block until the the script is evaluated and results are sent back by the server.
<4> Verify the result.
<5> Submit the same script to the server but don't block.
<6> Wait until request is written to the server and `ResultSet` is constructed.
<7> Read a single result off the result stream.
<8> Again, verify the result.
<9> Verify that the all results have been read and stream is closed.
<10> Close client and underlying pool connections.

[[gremlin-DotNet]]
== Gremlin.Net

image:gremlin-dotnet-logo.png[width=371,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin.Net implements Gremlin within the C# language. It targets .NET Standard and can
therefore be used on different operating systems and with different .NET frameworks, such as .NET Framework
and link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/core[.NET Core]. Since the C# syntax is very similar to that of Java, it should be very easy to switch between
Gremlin-Java and Gremlin.Net. The only major syntactical difference is that all method names in Gremlin.Net
use PascalCase as opposed to camelCase in Gremlin-Java in order to comply with .NET conventions.

[source,powershell]
nuget install Gremlin.Net

In Gremlin.Net there exists `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__` which mirror the respective classes
in Gremlin-Java. The `GraphTraversalSource` requires a driver in order to communicate with <<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>> (or any
RemoteConnection-enabled server).

The `Gremlin.Net.Driver.Remote.DriverRemoteConnection` is provided as part of Apache TinkerPop’s Gremlin.Net.

IMPORTANT: For developers wishing to provide another driver implementation, be sure to implement `IRemoteConnection` in
`Gremlin.Net.Process.Remote` so it can then be used by Gremlin.Net’s `GraphTraversal`.

When Gremlin Server is running, Gremlin.Net can communicate with Gremlin Server by sending traversals serialized as `Bytecode`.

IMPORTANT: Gremlin.Net is not compatible with GraphSON 1.0.

A traversal source can be spawned anonymously using an `AnonymousTraversalSource` which can be statically imported as
follows:

[source,csharp]
----
using static Gremlin.Net.Process.Traversal.AnonymousTraversalSource;
----

which will expose a static `Traversal()` method which can be used as follows to yield a `GraphTraversalSource` assigned
to "g" and configured to connect to Gremlin Server at "localhost:8182":

[source,csharp]
----
var remoteConnection = new DriverRemoteConnection(new GremlinClient(new GremlinServer("localhost", 8182)));
var g = Traversal().WithRemote(remoteConnection);
----

When a traversal from the `GraphTraversalSource` is iterated, the traversal’s `Bytecode` is sent over the wire via the registered
`IRemoteConnection`. The bytecode is used to construct the equivalent traversal at the remote traversal source.
Moreover, typically the bytecode is analyzed to determine which language the bytecode should be translated to. If the traversal
does not contain lambdas, the remote location (e.g. Gremlin Server) will typically
use Gremlin-Java. If it has lambdas written in Groovy, it will use Gremlin-Groovy (e.g. `GremlinGroovyScriptEngine`).
Likewise, if it has lambdas represented in Python, it will use Gremlin-Python (e.g. `GremlinJythonScriptEngine`).

IMPORTANT: Gremlin.Net’s `ITraversal` interface supports the standard Gremlin methods such as `Next()`, `NextTraverser()`, `ToSet()`,
`ToList()`, etc. Such "terminal" methods trigger the evaluation of the traversal.

=== RemoteConnection Submission

Very similar to Gremlin-Python and Gremlin-Java, there are various ways to submit a traversal to a `IRemoteConnection` using
terminal/action methods off of `ITraversal`.

* `ITraversal.Next()`
* `ITraversal.NextTraverser()`
* `ITraversal.ToList()`
* `ITraversal.ToSet()`
* `ITraversal.Iterate()`

=== Configuration

The following sections describe how the Gremlin.Net driver can be configured.

==== Gremlin Server

The connection properties for the Gremlin.Net driver can be passed to the `GremlinServer` instance as keyword arguments:

[width="100%",cols="3,10,^2",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Key |Description |Default
|hostname |The hostname that the driver will connect to. |localhost
|port |The port on which Gremlin Server can be reached. |8182
|enableSsl |Determines if SSL should be enabled or not. If enabled on the server then it must be enabled on the client. |false
|username |The username to submit on requests that require authentication. |_none_
|password |The password to submit on requests that require authentication. |_none_
|=========================================================

==== GraphSON Serialization

The Gremlin.Net driver uses by default GraphSON 3.0 but it is also possible to use GraphSON 2.0 which can be necessary
when the server does not support GraphSON 3.0 yet:

[source,csharp]
----
var client = new GremlinClient(new GremlinServer("localhost", 8182), new GraphSON2Reader(),
    new GraphSON2Writer(), GremlinClient.GraphSON2MimeType);
----

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `T`, `P`, `Order`, `Operator`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin.Net as classes.

These can be used analogously to how they are used in Gremlin-Java.

[source,csharp]
g.V().HasLabel("person").Has("age",P.Gt(30)).Order().By("age",Order.desc).ToList()

Moreover, the class prefixes can be omitted with a `using static`.

[source,csharp]
----
using static Gremlin.Net.Process.Traversal.P;
using static Gremlin.Net.Process.Traversal.Order;
----

Then it is possible to represent the above traversal as below.

[source,csharp]
g.V().HasLabel("person").Has("age",Gt(30)).Order().By("age",desc).ToList()

Finally, with using static `__`, anonymous traversals like `__.Out()` can be expressed as below. That is, without the `__.`-prefix.

[source,csharp]
g.V().Repeat(Out()).Times(2).Values("name").Fold().ToList()

=== Bindings

When a traversal bytecode is sent over a `IRemoteConnection` (e.g. Gremlin Server), it will be translated, compiled,
and then executed. If the same traversal is sent again, translation and compilation can be skipped as the previously
compiled version should be cached. Many traversals are unique up to some parameterization. For instance,
`g.V(1).Out("created").Values("name")` is considered different from `g.V(4).Out("created").Values("Name")`
as they have different script "string" representations. However, `g.V(x).Out("created").Values("name")` with bindings of 
`{x : 1}` and `{x : 4}` are considered the same. If a traversal is going to be executed repeatedly, but with different 
parameters, then bindings should be used. In Gremlin.Net, bindings are objects that can be created as follows.

[source,csharp]
----
var b = new Bindings();
g.V(b.Of("id", 1)).Out("created").Values("name").toList()
g.V(b.Of("id", 4)).Out("created").Values("name").toList()
----

=== Traversal Strategies

In order to add and remove traversal strategies from a traversal source, Gremlin.Net has an `AbstractTraversalStrategy`
class along with a collection of subclasses that mirror the standard Gremlin-Java strategies.

[source,csharp]
----
g = g.WithStrategies(new SubgraphStrategy(vertices: HasLabel("person"),
    edges: Has("weight", Gt(0.5))));
var names = g.V().Values("name").ToList();  // names: [marko, vadas, josh, peter]

g = g.WithoutStrategies(typeof(SubgraphStrategy));
names = g.V().Values("name").ToList(); // names: [marko, vadas, lop, josh, ripple, peter]

var edgeValueMaps = g.V().OutE().ValueMap().With(WithOptions.Tokens).ToList();
// edgeValueMaps: [[label:created, id:9, weight:0.4], [label:knows, id:7, weight:0.5], [label:knows, id:8, weight:1.0],
//     [label:created, id:10, weight:1.0], [label:created, id:11, weight:0.4], [label:created, id:12, weight:0.2]]

g = g.WithComputer(workers: 2, vertices: Has("name", "marko"));
names = g.V().Values("name").ToList();  // names: [marko]

edgeValueMaps = g.V().OutE().ValueMap().With(WithOptions.Tokens).ToList();
// edgeValueMaps: [[label:created, id:9, weight:0.4], [label:knows, id:7, weight:0.5], [label:knows, id:8, weight:1.0]]
----

NOTE: Many of the TraversalStrategy classes in Gremlin.Net are proxies to the respective strategy on Apache TinkerPop’s
JVM-based Gremlin traversal machine. As such, their `Apply(ITraversal)` method does nothing. However, the strategy is
encoded in the Gremlin.Net bytecode and transmitted to the Gremlin traversal machine for re-construction machine-side.

=== The Lambda Solution

Supporting link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[anonymous functions] across languages is difficult as
most languages do not support lambda introspection and thus, code analysis. While Gremlin.Net doesn't support C# lambdas, it
is still able to represent lambdas in other languages. When the lambda is represented in `Bytecode` its language is encoded
such that the remote connection host can infer which translator and ultimate execution engine to use.

[source,csharp]
----
g.V().Out().Map<int>(Lambda.Groovy("it.get().value('name').length()")).Sum<int>().ToList();      <1>
g.V().Out().Map<int>(Lambda.Python("lambda x: len(x.get().value('name'))")).Sum<int>().ToList(); <2>
----

<1> `Lambda.Groovy()` can be used to create a Groovy lambda. 
<2> `Lambda.Python()` can be used to create a Python lambda.

The `ILambda` interface returned by these two methods inherits interfaces like `IFunction` and `IPredicate` that mirror
their Java counterparts which makes it possible to use lambdas with Gremlin.Net for the same steps as in Gremlin-Java.

[[gremlin-javascript]]
== Gremlin-JavaScript

image:gremlin-js.png[width=130,float=right] Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin-JavaScript implements Gremlin within the
JavaScript language. It targets Node.js runtime and can be used on different operating systems on any Node.js 6 or
above. Since the JavaScript naming conventions are very similar to that of Java, it should be very easy to switch
between Gremlin-Java and Gremlin-JavaScript.

[source,bash]
npm install gremlin

The Gremlin-JavaScript provides `GraphTraversalSource`, `GraphTraversal`, and `__` which mirror the respective classes
in Gremlin-Java. The `GraphTraversalSource` requires a RemoteConnection implementation in order to communicate with
<<gremlin-server,GremlinServer>>.

[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const traversal = gremlin.process.AnonymousTraversalSource.traversal;
const DriverRemoteConnection = gremlin.driver.DriverRemoteConnection;
----

A traversal source can be spawned with `RemoteStrategy` from an `AnonymousTraversalSource`.

[source,javascript]
----
const g = traversal().withRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin'));
----

Gremlin-JavaScript supports plain text SASL authentication, you can set it on the connection options.

[source,javascript]
----
const authenticator = new gremlin.driver.auth.PlainTextSaslAuthenticator('myuser', 'mypassword');
const g = traversal().withRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin', { authenticator });
----

When a traversal from the `GraphTraversalSource` is iterated, the traversal’s `Bytecode` is sent over the wire via
the registered `RemoteConnection`. The bytecode is used to construct the equivalent traversal at the remote
traversal source.

Since Gremlin-JavaScript currently doesn't support lambda expressions, all traversals can be translated to
Gremlin-Java on the remote location (e.g. Gremlin Server).

WARNING: In Javascript, `from` and `in` are reserved words. Gremlin-Javascript simply postfixes `_` to the end of
these terms for their use with graph traversal. For instance: `g.V().in_().out()`

IMPORTANT: Gremlin-JavaScript’s `Traversal` base class supports the standard Gremlin methods such as `next()` and
`toList()` Such "terminal" methods trigger the evaluation of the traversal.

=== RemoteConnection Submission

In a similar way as in other GLVs, there are various ways to submit a traversal to a
`RemoteConnection` using terminal/action methods off of `Traversal`. Given that I/O operations in Node.js are
asynchronous by default, this terminal methods return a `Promise`.

* `Traversal.toList()`: Returns a `Promise` with an `Array` as result value.
* `Traversal.next()`: Returns a `Promise` with a `{ value, done }` tuple as result value, according to the
link:https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration[async iterator proposal].
* `Traversal.iterate()`: Returns a `Promise` without a value.


For example:

[source,javascript]
----
g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList()
  .then(names => console.log(names));
----

You can `await` the promises if you are using `async` functions.

[source,javascript]
----
const names = await g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList();
console.log(names);
----

=== Static Enums and Methods

Gremlin has various tokens (e.g. `t`, `P`, `order`, `direction`, etc.) that are represented in Gremlin-JavaScript as
objects.

[source,javascript]
g.V().hasLabel('person').has('age', P.gt(30)).order().by('age', order.desc).toList()

These objects must be required manually from the `process` namespace:

[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const P = gremlin.process.P;
----

Finally, using static `__` anonymous traversals like `__.out()` can be expressed as below:

[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const __ = gremlin.process.statics;

g.V().repeat(__.out()).times(2).values("name").fold().toList();
----

=== Submit Gremlin Scripts

Additionally, you can also send parametrized Gremlin scripts to the server as strings, using the
`Client` class in Gremlin-JavaScript.


[source,javascript]
----
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const client = new gremlin.driver.Client('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin', { traversalSource: 'g' });

const result1 = await client.submit('g.V(vid)', { vid: 1 });
const vertex = result1.first();

const result2 = await client.submit('g.V().hasLabel(label).tail(n)', { label: 'person', n: 3 });

// ResultSet is an iterable
for (const vertex of result2) {
  console.log(vertex.id);
}

----
