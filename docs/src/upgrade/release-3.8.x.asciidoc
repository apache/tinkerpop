*NOT OFFICIALLY NAMED YET*

== TinkerPop 3.8.0

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.8.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-8-0[changelog] for a
complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Simplification to g creation
The creation of "g" is the start point to writing Gremlin. There are a number of ways to create it, but TinkerPop has
long recommended the use of the anonymous `traversal()` function for this creation.
[source,groovy]
----
// for embedded cases
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = traversal().withEmbedded(graph)
// for remote cases
g = traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection.using(...)))
----
As of this release, those two methods have been deprecated in favor of just `with()` which means you could simply write:
[source,groovy]
----
// for embedded cases
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = traversal().with(graph)
// for remote cases
g = traversal().with(DriverRemoteConnection.using(...)))
----
That's a bit less to type, but also removes need to programmatically decide which function to call which hopefully
strengthens the abstraction further. To demonstrate this further consider this next example:
[source,groovy]
----
g = traversal().with("config.properties")
----
The properties file in the above example can either point to a remote configuration or a embedded configuration allowing
"g" to be switched as needed without code changes.
