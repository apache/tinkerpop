*4.0.0*

== TinkerPop 4.0.0

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/4.0.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-4-0-0[changelog] for a
complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Simplification to g creation

The creation of "g" is the start point to writing Gremlin. There are a number of ways to create it, but TinkerPop has
long recommended the use of the anonymous `traversal()` function for this creation.

[source,groovy]
----
// for embedded cases
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = traversal().withEmbedded(graph)

// for remote cases
g = traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection.using(...)))
----

As of this release, those two methods have been deprecated in favor of just `with()` which means you could simply write:

[source,groovy]
----
// for embedded cases
graph = TinkerGraph.open()
g = traversal().with(graph)

// for remote cases
g = traversal().with(DriverRemoteConnection.using(...)))
----

That's a bit less to type, but also removes need to programmatically decide which function to call which hopefully
strengthens the abstraction further. To demonstrate this further consider this next example:

[source,groovy]
----
g = traversal().with("config.properties")
----

The properties file in the above example can either point to a remote configuration or a embedded configuration allowing
"g" to be switched as needed without code changes.

==== Changes to deserialization for gremlin-javascript

Starting from this version, `gremlin-javascript` will deserialize `Set` data into a ECMAScript 2015 Set. Previously,
these were deserialized into arrays.

==== Improved handling of integer overflows

Integer overflows caused by addition and multiplication operations will throw an exception instead of being silently
skipped with incorrect result.

=== Upgrading for Providers

==== Renaming None Step to Discard
`none()`, which was deprecated in 3.7.2 favor of `discard()`, has been removed. In its place will be a new list
filtering step `none()`, which takes a predicate and passes lists with no elements matching the predicate.


==== Graph System Providers

===== AbstractAuthenticatorHandler Constructor

The deprecated one-arg constructor for `AbstractAuthenticationHandler` has been removed along with two-arg constructors
for the implementations. Gremlin Server formerly supported the two-arg `Authenticator`, and `Settings` constructor for
instantiating new custom instances. It now expects implementations of `AbstractAuthenticationHandler` to use a
three-arg constructor that takes `Authenticator`, `Authorizer`, and `Settings`.

==== Graph Driver Providers
