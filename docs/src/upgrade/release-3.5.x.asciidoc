=== Upgrading for Users

==== addV() and null

There was a bit of inconsistency in the handling of `null` in calls to `property()` depending on the type of mutation
being executed demonstrated as follows in earlier versions:

[source,text]
----
gremlin> g.V(1).property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
The AddPropertyStep does not have a provided value: AddPropertyStep({key=[y]})
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? [yN]N
gremlin> g.addV("test").property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
==>v[13]
gremlin> g.V(13).properties()
==>vp[x->1]
==>vp[z->2]
----

In this release, this behavior has been altered to become consistent as follows:

[source,text]
----
gremlin> g.V(1).property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
Property value can not be null
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? [yN]n
gremlin> g.addV().property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
Property value can not be null
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? [yN]
----
