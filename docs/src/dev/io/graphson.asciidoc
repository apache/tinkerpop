= GraphSON

image:../../../static/images/gremlin-graphson.png[width=350,float=left] GraphSON is a JSON-based format that is designed for human readable
output that is easily supported in any programming language through the wide-array of JSON parsing libraries that
exist on virtually all platforms. GraphSON versions 1 to 3 were considered to be both a "graph" format and a
generalized object serialization format. That characteristic makes it useful as a serialization format for Gremlin
Server where arbitrary objects of varying types may be returned as results. However, starting in GraphSON 4, GraphSON
is only intended to be a network serialization format that is only able to serialize specific types defined by the
format. It is only meant to be used with the TinkerPop HTTP API.

When considering GraphSON as a "graph" format, the relevant feature to consider is the `writeGraph` and `readGraph`
methods on the `GraphSONWriter` and `GraphSONReader` interfaces, respectively. These methods write the entire `Graph`
instance as output or read an entire `Graph` instance input and they do so in a way external to generalized object
serialization. In other words, the output of:

[source,java]
----
final Graph graph = TinkerFactory.createModern();
final GraphWriter writer = graph.io(IoCore.graphson()).writer();
writer.writeGraph("tinkerpop-modern.json");
----

will be different of:

[source,java]
----
final Graph graph = TinkerFactory.createModern();
final GraphWriter writer = graph.io(IoCore.graphson()).writer();
final OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("tinkerpop-modern.json");
writer.writeObject(os, graph);
----

Generalized object serialization will be discussed later in this section, so for now the focus will be on the "graph"
format. Unlike GraphML, GraphSON does not use an edge list format. It uses an adjacency list. In the adjacency list,
each vertex is essentially a line in the file and the vertex line contains a list of all the edges associated with
that vertex. The GraphSON 4.0 representation looks like this for the Modern toy graph:

[source,json]

At a glance, one can see that this is not a valid JSON document (although it is a valid https://jsonlines.org[JSON Lines] document). While that form may seem incorrect, there is a reason.
The "graph" format is designed by default to be splittable, such that distributed systems like Spark can easily divide
the GraphSON file for processing. If this data were represented as an "array of vertices" with square brackets at the
beginning and end of the file, the format would be less conducive to fit that purpose. It is possible to change this
behavior by building the `GraphSONWriter` with the `wrapAdjacencyList` setting set to `true`, in which case the output
will be a valid JSON document that looks like this:

[source,json]

  {"id":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":1},"label":"person","outE":{"created":[{"id":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":9},"inV":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":3},"properties":{"weight":{"@type":"g:Double","@value":0.4}}}],"knows":[{"id":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":7},"inV":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":2},"properties":{"weight":{"@type":"g:Double","@value":0.5}}},{"id":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":8},"inV":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":4},"properties":{"weight":{"@type":"g:Double","@value":1.0}}}]},"properties":{"name":[{"id":{"@type":"g:Int64","@value":0},"value":"marko"}],"age":[{"id":{"@type":"g:Int64","@value":1},"value":{"@type":"g:Int32","@value":29}}]}},

NOTE: The `writeGraph` method essentially calls `writeVertices` with the directionality of `BOTH`. The `writeVertices`
method simply calls `writeVertex` which detaches each `Vertex` instance into a directional `StarGraph` which forms
the basis for the format.

The following sections discuss the GraphSON object serialization format as available in each version of GraphSON. Core
to understanding these sections is to understand that GraphSON can be produced with and without types being embedded
in the output. Without embedded types, the type system is restricted to standard JSON types of `Object`, `List`,
`String`, `Number`, `Boolean` and that will lead to "lossyness" in the format (i.e. a float will be interpreted as
double). It is also worth considering that choosing a GraphSON format without embedded types may also restrict the
type of results that can be obtained. For example, `g.V().groupCount()` returns a format with a `Map`. That's fine
for GraphSON, but the key in that `Map` is a complex object (i.e. a `Vertex`) and as such is not compatible with JSON
itself which can only support `String` keys.

WARNING: The `application/json` mime type is shared with all versions of GraphSON and their variations and does not
reflect a particular one. Servers will return the GraphSON version and variation that this mime type is configured for
and it could be different (or change) from server to server. When building applications, it is recommended that the
mime type is made explicit on requests to avoid breaking changes or unexpected results.

[[graphson-4]]
== Version 4.0

Version 4.0 of GraphSON was first introduced on TinkerPop 4.0.0 and is represented by the
`application/vnd.gremlin-v4.0+json` mime type. There also exists an untyped version:
`application/vnd.gremlin-v4.0+json;types=false`. It is very similar to GraphSON 3.0, with just several key differences:
many underused or duplicated types have been removed, labels are now list of strings and request/response formats have
changed quite a bit, and custom types have been replaced with Provider Defined Type (PDT).
