[[policy-listing]]
== Provider Listing Policy

TinkerPop has two web site sections that help the community find TinkerPop-enabled providers, libraries and tools.
There is the link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/providers.html[Providers] page and the
link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/community.html[Community] page. The Providers page lists graph systems that are
TinkerPop-enabled. The Community page lists libraries and tools that are designed to work with TinkerPop providers and
include things like drivers, object-graph mappers, visualization applications and other similar tools.

To be listed in either page a project should meet the following requirements:

* The project must be either a TinkerPop-enabled graph system, a Gremlin language variant/compiler, a Gremlin language
driver, or a TinkerPop-enabled middleware tool.
* The project must have a public URL that can be referenced by Apache TinkerPop.
* The project must have at least one release.
* The project must be actively developed/maintained to a current or previous "y" version of Apache TinkerPop (3.y.z).
* The project must have some documentation and that documentation must make explicit its usage of Apache TinkerPop and
its version compatibility requirements.

Note that the Apache Software Foundation's link:https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/linking[linking policy]
supersede those stipulated by Apache TinkerPop. All things considered, if your project meets the requirements, please
email Apache TinkerPop's link:++https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@tinkerpop.apache.org++[developer mailing list]
requesting that your project be added to a listing.

== Graphic Usage Policy

Apache TinkerPop has a plethora of graphics that the community can use. There are four categories of graphics. These
categories and their respective policies are presented below. If you are unsure of the category of a particular
graphic, please ask on our link:++https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@tinkerpop.apache.org++[developer mailing list]
before using it. Finally, note that the Apache Software Foundation's
link:https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/[trademark policies] supersede those stipulated by Apache TinkerPop.

=== Character Graphics

A character graphic can be used without permission as long as its being used in an Apache TinkerPop related context
and it is acknowledged that the graphic is a trademark of the Apache Software Foundation/Apache TinkerPop.
