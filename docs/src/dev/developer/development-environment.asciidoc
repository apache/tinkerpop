= Development Environment

TinkerPop is fairly large body of code spread across many modules and covering multiple programming languages. Despite
this complexity, it remains relatively straightforward a project to build. This following subsections explain how to
configure a development environment for TinkerPop.

image:conspiracy.png[]

[[system-configuration]]
== System Configuration

At a minimum, development of TinkerPop requires link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java 1.8.0_40+]
and link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.2.5+]. Maven is used as the common build system, which even
controls the builds of non-JVM link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/[GLVs]
such as `gremlin-python`. Java and Maven are described as a "minimum" for a development environment, because they
will only build JVM portions of TinkerPop and many integration tests will not fire with this simple setup. It is
possible to get a clean and successful build with this minimum, but it will not be possible to build non-JVM aspects
of the project and those will go untested.

To gain the ability to execute all aspects of the TinkerPop build system, other environmental configurations must be
established. Those prerequisites are defined in the following subsections.

IMPORTANT: For those who intend to offer a contribution, building with a minimal configuration may not be sufficient
when submitting a pull request. Consider setting up the full environment.

NOTE: For those using Windows, efforts have been made to keep the build OS independent, but, in practice, it is likely
that TinkerPop's build system will only allow for a minimum build at best.

[[groovy-environment]]
=== Groovy Environment

Groovy is not used in the standard build, but when generating documentation it does require the loading of a Gremlin
Console instance. The Gremlin Console is Groovy-based and the documentation bootstrapping loads TinkerPop plugins
which requires proper configuration of Graph/Ivy dependency loaders as described in the
link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference/#gremlin-applications[Gremlin Applications Section] of the
Reference Documentation.

The base configuration described in that link may need to be modified if there is a desire to work with the Gremlin
Console (for documentation generation or just general testing) in a way that utilizes SNAPSHOT releases in the
Apache Snapshots Repository. In that case, the `grapeConfig.xml` will need to include a resolver for that repository
and the basic Ivy configuration will look as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<ivysettings>
  <settings defaultResolver="downloadGrapes"/>
  <resolvers>
    <chain name="downloadGrapes" returnFirst="true">
      <filesystem name="cachedGrapes">
        <ivy pattern="${user.home}/.groovy/grapes/[organisation]/[module]/ivy-[revision].xml"/>
        <artifact pattern="${user.home}/.groovy/grapes/[organisation]/[module]/[type]s/[artifact]-[revision](-[classifier]).[ext]"/>
      </filesystem>
      <ibiblio name="localm2" root="${user.home.url}/.m2/repository/" checkmodified="true" changingPattern=".*" changingMatcher="regexp" m2compatible="true"/>
      <ibiblio name="jcenter" root="https://jcenter.bintray.com/" m2compatible="true"/>
      <ibiblio name="ibiblio" m2compatible="true"/>
      <ibiblio name="apache-snapshots" root="http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/" m2compatible="true"/>
    </chain>
  </resolvers>
</ivysettings>
----

The above configuration is just a modification of the default. Perhaps the most lean common configuration might just
be:

[source,xml]
----
<ivysettings>
  <settings defaultResolver="downloadGrapes"/>
  <resolvers>
    <chain name="downloadGrapes">
      <ibiblio name="local" root="file:${user.home}/.m2/repository/" m2compatible="true"/>
      <ibiblio name="central" root="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/" m2compatible="true"/>
    </chain>
  </resolvers>
</ivysettings>
----

In the above case, the configuration largely relies on the standard Maven builds to create a well cached `.m2`
directory. Under typical development circumstances, SNAPSHOT will find themselves deployed there locally and that
is all that will be required for Grape to do its work.

As a final word, it is important to take note of the order used for these references as Grape will check them in the order
they are specified and depending on that order, an artifact other than the one expected may be used which is typically
an issue when working with SNAPSHOT dependencies.

[[documentation-environment]]
=== Documentation Environment

The documentation generation process is not Maven-based and uses shell scripts to process the project's asciidoc. The
scripts should work on Mac and Linux.

To generate documentation, it is required that link:https://hadoop.apache.org[Hadoop 2.7.x] is running in
link:https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html#Pseudo-Distributed_Operation[pseudo-distributed]
mode. Be sure to set the `HADOOP_GREMLIN_LIBS` environment variable as described in the
link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#hadoop-gremlin[reference documentation]. It is also important
to set the `CLASSPATH` to point at the directory containing the Hadoop configuration files, like `mapred-site.xml`.

Also note that link:http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html[awk] version `4.0.1` is required for documentation generation.

Documentation can be generated locally with:

[source,text]
bin/process-docs.sh

Documentation is generated to the `target/docs` directory. It is also possible to generate documentation locally with
Docker. `docker/build.sh -d`.

To generate the web site locally, there is no need for any of the above infrastructure. Site generation is a simple
shell script:

[source,text]
bin/generate-home.sh

The site will be generated to the `target/site/home` directory.

[[python-environment]]
=== Python Environment

As of TinkerPop 3.2.2, the build optionally requires link:https://www.python.org/[Python] to build the `gremlin-python`
module. If Python is not installed, TinkerPop will still build with Maven, but native Python tests and
Java tests that require Python code will be skipped. Developers should also install link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip[pip]
and link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/[virtualenv] (version 15.0.2 - older versions may cause build failures).

The build expects two Python executables `python` and `python3` where `python` maps to 2.7.6 and `python3` is 3.4.3 or
higher. Once the Python environment is established, the full building and testing of `gremlin-python` may commence. It
can be done manually from the command line with:

[source,text]
mvn clean install -Pglv-python

which enables the "glv-python" Maven profile or in a more automated fashion simply add a `.glv` file to the root of the
`gremlin-python` module which will signify to Maven that the environment is Python-ready. The `.glv` file need not have
any contents and is ignored by Git. A standard `mvn clean install` will then build `gremlin-python` in full.

As of TinkerPop 3.2.5, the build also requires Python to execute `gremlin-console` integration tests. The integration
test is configured by a "console-integration-tests" Maven profile. This profile can be activated manually or can more
simply piggy-back on the `.glv` file in `gremlin-python`. Note that unlike `gremlin-python` the tests are actually
integration tests and therefore must be actively switched on with `-DskipIntegrationTests=false`:

[source,text]
mvn clean install -pl gremlin-console -DskipIntegrationTests=false

TIP: For those who do not have a full Maven environment, please see <<docker-integration,this section>> for how Docker
can be used to help run tests.

See the <<release-environment,Release Environment>> section for more information on release manager configurations.

[[dotnet-environment]]
=== DotNet Environment

The build optionally requires link:https://www.microsoft.com/net/core[.NET Core SDK] (>=3.1) to work with the
`gremlin-dotnet` module. If .NET Core SDK is not installed, TinkerPop will still build with Maven, but .NET projects
will be skipped.

`gremlin-dotnet` can be built and tested from the command line with:

[source,text]
mvn clean install -Pgremlin-dotnet

which enables the "gremlin-dotnet" Maven profile or in a more automated fashion simply add a `.glv` file to the `src`
and `test` directories of the `gremlin-dotnet` module  which will signify to Maven that the environment is .NET-ready.
The `.glv` file need not have any contents and is ignored by Git. A standard `mvn clean install` will then build
`gremlin-dotnet` in full.

In order to pack the Gremlin.Net.Template project, it is also necessary to install link:http://www.mono-project.com/[Mono].
The template can still be built and tested without Mono but packing will be skipped.
To pack the template (which will also download the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/nuget-exe-cli-reference[NuGet CLI tool])
the `nuget` property has to be set:

[source,text]
mvn clean install -Dnuget

TIP: For those who do not have a full Maven environment, please see <<docker-integration,this section>> for how Docker
can be used to help run tests.

See the <<release-environment,Release Environment>> section for more information on release manager configurations.

[[nodejs-environment]]
=== JavaScript Environment

When building `gremlin-javascript`, mvn command will include a local copy of Node.js runtime and npm inside your project
using `com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin` plugin. This copy of the Node.js runtime will not affect any
other existing Node.js runtime instances in your machine.

TIP: For those who do not have a full Maven environment, please see <<docker-integration,this section>> for how Docker
can be used to help run tests.

See the <<release-environment,Release Environment>> section for more information on release manager configurations.

[[docker-environment]]
=== Docker Environment

The build optionally requires Docker to build Docker images of Gremlin Server and Gremlin Console. The Docker images
can be built from the command line with:

[source,text]
----
mvn clean install -pl gremlin-server,gremlin-console -DdockerImages
----

which enables the "docker-images" Maven profile.

[[release-environment]]
=== Release Environment

This section is only useful to TinkerPop release managers and describes prerequisites related to deploying an official
release of TinkerPop. All Apache releases must be signed. Please see link:http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html[this guide]
in the Apache documentation for instructions on to set up gpg. Keys should be added to KEYS files in both the
link:https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/tinkerpop/KEYS[development] and
link:https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/tinkerpop/KEYS[release] distribution directories and committed
using Apache Subversion (SVN).

For Python releases, uploading to pypi uses link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine[twine] which is automatically
installed by the build process in maven. Twine refers to `HOME/.pypirc` file for configuration on the pypi deploy
environments and username and password combinations. The file typically looks like this:

[source,text]
----
[distutils]
index-servers=
    pypi
    pypitest

[pypitest]
username = <username>
password =

[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username = <username>
password =
----

The release manager shall use the project's pypi credentials, which are available in the
link:https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/tinkerpop[PMC SVN repository]. The `password` should be left blank so
the deployment process in Maven will prompt for it at deployment time.

For .NET releases, install link:http://www.mono-project.com/[Mono]. The release process is known to work with 5.0.1,
so it is best to probably install that version. Release managers should probably also do an install of
link:https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v3.4.4/nuget.exe[nuget 3.4.4] as it will help with environmental setup.
To get an environment ready to deploy to NuGet, it is necessary to have a NuGet API key. First, create an account with
link:https://www.nuget.org[nuget] and request that a PMC member add your account to the Gremlin.Net and
the Gremlin.Net.Template package in nuget so that you can deploy. Next, generate an API key for your account on the
nuget website. The API key should be added to `NuGet.Config` with the following:

[source,text]
----
mono nuget.exe setApiKey [your-api-key]
----

This should update `~/.config/NuGet/NuGet.Config` a file with an entry containing the encrypted API key. On
`mvn deploy`, this file will be referenced on the automated `nuget push`.

To deploy `gremlin-javascript` on the link:https://www.npmjs.com[npm registry], the release manager must set the
authentication information on the ~/.npmrc file. The easiest way to do that is to use the `npm adduser` command. This
must be done only once, as the auth token doesn't have an expiration date and it's stored on your file system. If
this account is newly created then request that a PMC member add your account to the "gremlin" package on npm.

Deploying Docker images to link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] requires an account that is a member of the TinkerPop
organization. So if you don't already have an account on Docker Hub then create one and request that
a PMC member adds your account to the TinkerPop organization. Afterwards, authentication information needs to be added to
the `~/.docker/config.json` file. This information can simply be added with the `docker login` command which will ask for
credentials. This must be done only once. Finally, `docker push` can be used to push images to Docker Hub which will
be done automatically on `mvn deploy` or it can be triggered manually with `mvn dockerfile:push`.

[[building-testing]]
== Building and Testing

The following commands are a mix of Maven flags and shell scripts that handle different build operations

* Build project: `mvn clean install`
** Build a specific module (e.g. `gremlin-server`) within the project: `mvn clean install -pl gremlin-server`
** Build without assertions for "iterator leaks" which are enabled by default: `mvn clean install -DtestIteratorLeaks=false`
** Specify specific tests in a TinkerPop Suite to run with the `GREMLIN_TESTS` environment variable, along with the
Maven project list argument, e.g.:
+
----
export GREMLIN_TESTS='org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.step.map.PathTest$Traversals,org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.PathTest'
mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true --projects tinkergraph-gremlin test
----
** Clean the `.groovy/grapes/org.apache.tinkerpop` directory on build: `mvn clean install -DcleanGrapes`
** Turn off "heavy" logging in the "process" tests: `mvn clean install -DargLine="-DmuteTestLogs=true"`
** The test suite for `neo4j-gremlin` is disabled by default - to turn it on: `mvn clean install -DincludeNeo4j`
* Generate <<building-testing,test resources>> for `gremlin-io-test`: `mvn clean install -pl :gremlin-io-test -Dio`
* Regenerate toy graph data (only necessary given changes to IO classes): `mvn clean install -Dio` from `tinkergraph-gremlin` directory
** If there are changes to the Gryo format, it may be necessary to generate the Grateful Dead dataset from GraphSON (see `IoDataGenerationTest.shouldWriteGratefulDead`)
* Start Gremlin Server with Docker using the standard test configuration: `docker/gremlin-server.sh`
* Check license headers are present: `mvn apache-rat:check`
* Build AsciiDocs (see <<documentation-environment,Documentation Environment>>): `bin/process-docs.sh`
** Build AsciiDocs (but don't evaluate code blocks): `bin/process-docs.sh --dryRun`
** Build AsciiDocs (but don't evaluate code blocks in specific files): `bin/process-docs.sh --dryRun docs/src/reference/the-graph.asciidoc,docs/src/tutorial/getting-started,...`
** Build AsciiDocs (but evaluate code blocks only in specific files): `bin/process-docs.sh --fullRun docs/src/reference/the-graph.asciidoc,docs/src/tutorial/getting-started,...`
** Process a single AsciiDoc file: +pass:[docs/preprocessor/preprocess-file.sh `pwd`/gremlin-console/target/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-console-*-standalone "" "*" `pwd`/docs/src/xyz.asciidoc]+
* Build JavaDocs/JSDoc: `mvn process-resources -Djavadoc`
** Javadoc to `target/site/apidocs` directory
** JSDoc to the `gremlin-javascript/src/main/javascript/gremlin-javascript/doc/` directory
* Check for Apache License headers: `mvn apache-rat:check`
* Specify the seed used for `Random` in tests `mvn clean install -DtestSeed` - useful when a test fails, the seed will be printed in the build output so that the test can run with the same version of random (look for "TestHelper" logger in output)
* Check for newer dependencies: `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` or `mvn versions:display-plugin-updates`
* Check the effective `pom.xml`: `mvn -pl gremlin-python -Pglv-python help:effective-pom -Doutput=withProfilePom.xml`
* Deploy JavaDocs/AsciiDocs: `bin/publish-docs.sh svn-username`
* Integration Tests: `mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false`
** Execute with the `-DincludeNeo4j` option to include transactional tests.
** Execute with the `-DuseEpoll` option to try to use Netty native transport (works on Linux, but will fallback to Java NIO on other OS).
* Benchmarks: `mvn verify -DskipBenchmarks=false`
** Reports are generated to the console and to `gremlin-tools/gremlin-benchmark/target/reports/benchmark`.
* Test coverage report: `mvn clean install -Dcoverage` - note that the `install` is necessary because report aggregation is bound to that part of the lifecycle.
** Reports are generated to `gremlin-tools/gremlin-coverage/target/site`.
* `cd site`
** Generate web site locally: `bin/generate-home.sh`
** Publish web site: `bin/publish-home.sh <username>`

[[docker-integration]]
== Docker Integration

TinkerPop provides a shell script, that can start several build tasks within a Docker container. The
required Docker images will be built automatically if they don't exist yet. Thus the first invocation
of the Docker script is expected to take some time.

The script can be found under `PROJECT_HOME/docker/build.sh`. The following tasks are currently
supported:

* run standard test suite
* run integration tests
* build Java docs
* build user docs

A list of command line options is provided by `docker/build.sh --help`. The container will install,
configure and start all required dependencies, such as Hadoop.

Options can be passed to Docker by setting the `TINKERPOP_DOCKER_OPTS` environment variable. A speed boost can
be gained at the expense of memory by using tmpfs and the special directory `/usr/src/tinkermem`.

[source,bash]
.Build in-memory
----
TINKERPOP_DOCKER_OPTS="--tmpfs /usr/src/tinkermem:exec,mode=0755,rw,noatime,size=2000m"
----

[source,bash]
.Disable IPv6 for Hadoop
----
TINKERPOP_DOCKER_OPTS="--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1"
----

A custom maven settings.xml can be supplied, for example, to point to a local proxy. Copy the `settings.xml` to the
`PROJECT_HOME/` directory. The Docker script will detect and copy it to the running container.

If the container is used to generate the user docs, it will start a web server and show the URL that
is used to host the HTML docs.

After finishing all tasks, the script will immediately destroy the container.

Docker can also be helpful to developers who do not want to run tests from a Maven environment, which may be a bit
opaque when dealing with test failures and largely unhelpful for debugging. This situation is typically case for
developers doing work on Gremlin Language Variants (e.g. Python). To help alleviate this problem, developers can
start a standalone Gremlin Server with its standard test configuration that is used in the standard Maven build.

Generally speaking, most developers will want to test their code against the latest build of Gremlin Server in the
TinkerPop repository. To do that, first be sure to build a Docker image of the current code:

[source,bash]
mvn clean install -DskipTests

Next, generate the a Docker image for Gremlin Server with:

[source,bash]
mvn clean install -pl :gremlin-server -DdockerImages -DskipTests

IMPORTANT: If changes are made to the repository that need to be reflected in the Gremlin Server Docker image then
the old image should be removed and then the above commands re-executed.

Finally, start the server with:

[source,bash]
docker/gremlin-server.sh

Starting Gremlin Server this way makes it possible to run Gremlin Language Variant tests without Maven (for example,
directly from a debugger) which should greatly reduce development friction for these environments.

It is also possible to specify the exact version of Gremlin Server to run with the test configuration. This version
should be an existing Docker image version and must be an explicit version that maps to an actual TinkerPop artifact:

[source,bash]
docker/gremlin-server.sh 3.4.2

To be a bit more clear, the version can not be a Docker tag like "latest" because there is no such TinkerPop artifact
that has been published with that version number.

== IDE Setup with Intellij

This section refers specifically to setup within Intellij.  TinkerPop has a module called `gremlin-shaded` which
contains shaded dependencies for some libraries that are widely used and tend to introduce conflicts.  To ensure
that Intellij properly interprets this module after importing the Maven `pom.xml` perform the following steps:

. Build `gremlin-shaded` from the command line with `mvn clean install`.
. Right-click on the `gremlin-shaded` module in the project viewer of Intellij and select "Remove module". If this menu
option is not available (as is the case in newer versions of Intellij - first noticed in 13.1.5), then open the "Maven
Projects" side panel, right click the `gremlin-shaded` module and select "Ignore Project".
. In the "Maven Projects" Tool window and click the tool button for "Reimport All Maven projects" (go to
`View | Tool Windows | Maven Projects` on the main menu if this panel is not activated).
. At this point it should be possible to compile and run the tests within Intellij, but in the worst case, use
`File | Invalidate Caches/Restart` to ensure that indices properly rebuild.

Note that it may be necessary to re-execute these steps if the `gremlin-shaded` `pom.xml` is ever updated.

Developers working on the `neo4j-gremlin` module should enabled the `include-neo4j` Maven profile in Intellij.
This will ensure that tests will properly execute within the IDE.

If Intellij complains about "duplicate sources" for the Groovy files when attempting to compile/run tests, then
install the link:http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7442?pr=idea[GMavenPlus Intellij plugin].

The `gremlin-core` module uses a Java annotation processor to help support DSLs. To support this capability be sure
that:

. `File | Settings | Compiler | Annotation Processors` has the checkbox with the "Enable annotation processing" checked.
Intellij should be able to detect the processor automatically on build.
. The `gremlin-core/target` directory should not be hidden and `target/classes`, `target/generated-sources` and
`target/generated-test-sources` should be marked as "Generated Sources Root". If they are not setup that way by
Intellij by default then simply right-click on them use the "Mark Directory with" option to make the appropriate
selections.
