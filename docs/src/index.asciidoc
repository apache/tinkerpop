Apache TinkerPopâ„¢ has an extensive set of documentation that covers virtually all aspects of usage. This documentation
tends to fall into the following categories:

1. link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference[Reference Documentation] - The primary documentation for
TinkerPop which provides the most complete guide to TinkerPop usage. All other documentation tends to exist in support
of this reference guide.
2. <<tutorials,Tutorials>> - Brief but detailed explanations of specific technologies, patterns, use cases or best
practices related to TinkerPop.
3. <<publications,Publications>> - Blog posts, technical papers, presentation materials, etc.
4. link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/dev/developer[Developer] - Documentation for contributors to TinkerPop or for providers (i.e. those who implement
TinkerPop's interfaces).
5. link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/javadocs/x.y.z/full/[Javadoc] - The full Javadoc for all TinkerPop modules. There
is also an abridged version of the link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/javadocs/x.y.z/core/[core] interfaces which may
be more convenient in some cases.
6. link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/dotnetdocs/x.y.z/[.NET Docs] - The API documentation for Gremlin.Net.
7. link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/jsdocs/x.y.z/[JSDoc] - The JSDoc for gremlin-javascript.
8. link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/upgrade/[Upgrade Documentation] - Notes related to upgrading from one
version of TinkerPop to the next. This document describes breaking changes, major new features and other important
information related to a particular version.

NOTE: Some of the documentation listed here leads to third-party web sites. Such documentation is supplemental to
Apache TinkerPop. Third-party documentation is marked as such in the listings below.
