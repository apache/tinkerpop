TinkerPop Compendium
====================

image::tinkerpop-reading.png[width=800,align="center"]

The primary documentation for Apache TinkerPop is the link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/reference[Reference Documentation],
which provides the most complete guide to TinkerPop usage. All other documentation tends to exist in support of that
reference guide. Other documentation tends to fall into one of these other categories:

1. <<tutorials,Tutorials>> - Brief but detailed explanations of specific technologies, patterns, use cases or best practices related
to TinkerPop.
2. <<publications,Publications>> - Blog posts, technical papers, presentation materials, etc.
3. <<developer,Developer>> - Documentation for contributors to TinkerPop or for providers (i.e. those who implement TinkerPop's
interfaces).

NOTE: Some of the documentation listed here leads to third-party web sites. Such documentation is supplemental to
Apache TinkerPop. Third-party documentation is marked as such in the listings below.
