TinkerPop 3.1.0
===============

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/master/docs/static/images/gremlin-gangster.png[width=225]

*A 187 On The Undercover Gremlinz*

TinkerPop 3.1.0
---------------

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Additional upgrade information can be found here:

* <<_tinkerpop_3_0_2,TinkerPop 3.0.2>>
* <<_tinkerpop_3_0_1,TinkerPop 3.0.1>>

Important Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `sum()`, `min()`, `max()` and `mean()` make now use of `NumberHelper`, leading to a more appropriate result type, instead of just `Double`.
* `GraphStep` is no longer in `sideEffect`-package, but now in `map`-package as traversals support mid-traversal `V()`.
* Traversals now support mid-traversal `V()`-steps. Graph system providers should ensure that a mid-traversal `V()` can leverage any suitable index.
* The data type of `Operator` enums will now always be the highest common data type of the two given numbers, rather than the data type of the first number, as it's been before.
* The Gephi Plugin has improved integration with Gephi, where manually inserting `store` steps to visualize a running traversal is no longer required.
* Entire TinkerGraph instances can be serialized over Gryo.
* Hadoop1 support has been dropped. Hadoop2 is now supported. Giraph and Spark can work over Hadoop2 YARN.
* The implementation and semantics of `GraphTraversal.group()` has changed. The previous model is deprecated and renamed to `groupV3d0()`.
* `PartitionStrategy` now supports `VertexProperty` such those properties can be added to partitions.
* The Jackson library is now "shaded" and included in the `gremlin-shaded` module.
* Configuration for Netty link:http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html[native transport] support in Gremlin Server.
* The `Channelizer` implementation for Gremlin Driver can now be changed via configuration.
* TinkerGraph is now serializable over Gryo so it is possible to request subgraphs via Gremlin Server (and `:remote`).

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop/blob/3.1.0-incubating/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

Upgrading for Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gremlin Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transaction.close() Default Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default behavior of `Transaction.close()` is to rollback the transaction.  This is in contrast to previous versions
where the default behavior was commit.  Using rollback as the default should be thought of as a like a safer approach
to closing where a user must now explicitly call `commit()` to persist their mutations.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-805[TINKERPOP3-805] for more information.

Hadoop-Gremlin Updates
++++++++++++++++++++++

* Hadoop1 is no longer supported. Hadoop2 is now the only supported Hadoop version in TinkerPop.
* Spark and Giraph have been split out of Hadoop-Gremlin into their own respective packages (Spark-Gremlin and Giraph-Gremlin).
* The directory where application jars are stored in HDFS is now `hadoop-gremlin-x.y.z-libs`.
** This versioning is important so that cross-version TinkerPop use does not cause jar conflicts.

Spark-Gremlin Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++

* Providers that wish to reuse a graphRDD can leverage the new `PersistedInputRDD` and `PersistedOutputRDD`.
** This allows the graphRDD to avoid serialization into HDFS for reuse. Be sure to enabled persisted `SparkContext` (see documentation).

TinkerGraph-Gremlin Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* The `public static String` configurations have been renamed. The old `public static` variables have been deprecated.


Gremlin Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graph Traversal Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* `ConjunctionStrategy` has been renamed to `ConnectiveStrategy` (no other behaviors changed).
* `ConjunctionP` has been renamed to `ConnectiveP` (no other behaviors changed).
* `DedupBijectionStrategy` has been renamed (and made more effective) as `FilterRankingStrategy`.
* The `GraphTraversal` mutation API has change significantly with all previous methods being supported but deprecated.
** The general pattern used now is `addE('knows').from(select('a')).to(select('b')).property('weight',1.0)`.
* The `GraphTraversal` sack API has changed with all previous methods being supported but deprecated.
** The old `sack(mult,'weight')` is now `sack(mult).by('weight')`.
* `GroupStep` has been redesigned such that there is now only a key- and value-traversal. No more reduce-traversal.
** The previous `group()`-methods have been renamed to `groupV3d0()`. To immediately upgrade, rename all your `group()`-calls to `groupV3d0()`.
** To migrate to the new `group()`-methods, what was `group().by('age').by(outE()).by(sum(local))` is now `group().by('age').by(outE().sum())`.
* There was a bug in `fold()`, where if a bulked traverser was provided, the traverser was only represented once.
** This bug fix might cause a breaking change to a user query if the non-bulk behavior was being counted on. If so, used `dedup()` prior to `fold()`.
* Both `GraphTraversal().mapKeys()` and `GraphTraversal.mapValues()` has been deprecated.
** Use `select(keys)` and `select(columns)`. However, note that `select()` will not unroll the keys/values. Thus, `mapKeys()` => `select(keys).unfold()`.

Gremlin-Groovy Updates
++++++++++++++++++++++

* The closure wrappers classes `GFunction`, `GSupplier`, `GConsumer` have been deprecated.
** In Groovy, a closure can be specified using `as Function` and thus, these wrappers are not needed.
* The `GremlinExecutor.promoteBindings()` method which was previously deprecated has been removed.

Upgrading for Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All providers should be aware that Jackson is now shaded to `gremlin-shaded` and could represent breaking change if
there was usage of the dependency by way of TinkerPop, a direct dependency to Jackson may be required on the
provider's side.

Graph System Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decomposition of AbstractTransaction
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `AbstractTransaction` class has been abstracted into two different classes supporting two different modes of
operation: `AbstractThreadLocalTransaction` and `AbstractThreadedTransaction`, where the former should be used when
supporting `ThreadLocal` transactions and the latter for threaded transactions.  Of course, providers may still
choose to build their own implementation on `AbstractTransaction` itself or simply implementing the `Transaction`
interface.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-765[TINKERPOP3-765] for more information.

Transaction.close() Default Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default behavior for `Transaction.close()` is to rollback the transaction and is enforced by tests, which
previously asserted the opposite (i.e. commit on close).  These tests have been renamed to suite the new semantics:

* `shouldCommitOnCloseByDefault` became `shouldCommitOnCloseWhenConfigured`
* `shouldRollbackOnCloseWhenConfigured` became `shouldRollbackOnCloseByDefault`

If these tests were referenced in an `OptOut`, then their names should be updated.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-805[TINKERPOP3-805] for more information.

Graph Traversal Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++++

There were numerous changes to the `GraphTraversal` API. Nearly all changes are backwards compatible with respective
"deprecated" annotations. Please review the respective updates specified in the "Graph System Users" section.

* `GraphStep` is no longer in `sideEffect` package. Now in `map` package.
* Make sure mid-traversal `GraphStep` calls are folding `HasContainers` in for index-lookups.
* Think about copying `TinkerGraphStepStrategyTest` for your implementation so you know folding is happening correctly.

Element Removal
+++++++++++++++

`Element.Exceptions.elementAlreadyRemoved` has been deprecated and test enforcement for consistency have been removed.
 Providers are free to deal with deleted elements as they see fit.

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-297[TINKERPOP3-297] for more information.

VendorOptimizationStrategy Rename
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `VendorOptimizationStrategy` has been renamed to `ProviderOptimizationStrategy`.  This renaming is consistent
with revised terminology for what were formerly referred to as "vendors".

See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3-876[TINKERPOP3-876] for more information.

GraphComputer Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++

`GraphComputer.configure(String key, Object value)` is now a method (with default implementation).
This allows the user to specify engine-specific parameters to the underlying OLAP system. These parameters are not intended
to be cross engine supported. Moreover, if there are not parameters that can be altered (beyond the standard `GraphComputer`
methods), then the provider's `GraphComputer` implementation should simply return and do nothing.
