Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/[homepage]
* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/docs/3.0.0.M8/[user documentation]
* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/javadocs/3.0.0.M8/core/[core javadoc]
* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/javadocs/3.0.0.M8/full/[full javadoc]

Building and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Build Project: `mvn clean install`
** Specify specific tests in a TinkerPop Suite to run: `mvn test -Dgremlin.tests={test class 1, test class 2...}` - note that including a specific test may require its inner class implementation (e.g. `org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin....UnionTest$ComputerTest`)
** Clean the `.groovy/grapes/org.apache.tinkerpop` directory on build: `mvn clean install -DcleanGrapes`
* Regenerate test data (only necessary given changes to IO classes): `mvn clean install -Dio` from `tinkergraph-gremlin` directory
* Check license headers are present: `mvn apache-rat:check`
* Build AsciiDocs: `docs/preprocessor/preprocess.sh && mvn process-resources -Dasciidoc`
* Build JavaDocs: `mvn process-resources -Djavadoc`
* Check for Apache License headers: `mvn apache-rat:check`
* Deploy JavaDocs/AsciiDocs: `bin/publish-docs.sh svn-username`
* Integration Tests: `mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false`
* Performance Tests: `mvn verify -DskipPerformanceTests=false`
* Gatling Load Tests: `mvn test -Pgatling -Dhost={hostname}`

IDE Setup
^^^^^^^^^

This section refers specifically to setup within Intellij.  TinkerPop has a module called `gremlin-shaded` which contains shaded dependencies for some libraries that are widely used and tend to introduce conflicts.  To ensure that Intellij properly interprets this module after importing the Maven `pom.xml` perform the following steps:

. Build `gremlin-shaded` from the command line with `mvn clean install`.
. Right-click on the `gremlin-shaded` module in the project viewer of Intellij and select "Remove module".
. In the "Maven Projects" Tool window and click the tool button for "Reimport All Maven projects" (go to `View | Tool Windows | Maven Projects` on the main menu if this panel is not activated).
. At this point it should be possible to compile and run the tests within Intellij, but in the worst case, use `File | Invalidate Caches/Restart` to ensure that indices properly rebuild.

Note that it maybe be necessary to re-execute these steps if the `gremlin-shaded` `pom.xml` is ever updated.

Release Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. `mvn clean install`
.. `mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false`
.. `mvn verify -DskipPerformanceTests=false`
. Update `CHANGELOG.asciidoc` with release date
. `bin/bump.sh "version"` to update project files to reference the non-SNAPSHOT version
. `git diff` and review the updated files (expect all `pom.xml` files and this README)
. `git commit -a -m "TinkerPop x.y.z release"` and `git push`
. `git tag -a -m "TinkerPop x.y.z release" x.y.z` and `git push --tags`
. `bin/publish-docs.sh <username>`
. `mvn deploy -Papache-release -DcreateChecksum=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true`- deploy signed artifacts with checksums to Apache Nexus for release voting
. Close the staging repository
. Submit for `[VOTE]` at `general@incubator.apache.org`

Issue Tracker Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinkerPop3 uses Apache JIRA as its link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3[issue tracker].  JIRA is a very robust piece of software with many options and configurations.  To simplify usage and ensure consistency across issues, the following conventions should be adhered to:

* An issue's "status" should be in one of two states: `open` or `closed`.
** An `open` issue is newly created, under consideration or otherwise in progress.
** A `closed` issue is completed for purposes of release (i.e. code, testing, and documentation complete).
* An issue's "type" should be one of two options: `bug` or `improvement`.  A `bug` has a very specific meaning, referring to an error that prevents usage of TinkerPop AND does not have a reasonable workaround.  Given that definition, a `bug` should generally have very high priority for a fix.  Everything else is an `improvement` in the sense that any other work is an enhancement to the current codebase.
* The "component" should be representative of the primary area of code that it applies to and all issues should have this property set.
* The "priority" of an issue is represented by two states `critical` and `major`.  It should be assigned as follows:
** If the issue is a `bug` then the "priority" should be `critical`.
** If the issue is an `improvement` then the "priority should be `major`.
* Issues are not assigned "labels".
* Until there is an official release "affected versionq" should be left empty.
