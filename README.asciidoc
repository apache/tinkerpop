Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/[user documentation]
* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/javadocs/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/core/[core javadoc]
* link:http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/javadocs/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/full/[full javadoc]

Building and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinkerPop requires `Java 1.8.0_40+` for proper building and proper operations.

* Build Project: `mvn clean install`
** Specify specific tests in a TinkerPop Suite to run with the `GREMLIN_TESTS` environment variable, along with the Maven project list argument, e.g.:
+
----
export GREMLIN_TESTS='org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.step.map.PathTest$Traversals,org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.step.util.PathTest'
mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true --projects tinkergraph-gremlin test
----
** Clean the `.groovy/grapes/org.apache.tinkerpop` directory on build: `mvn clean install -DcleanGrapes`
** Turn off "heavy" logging in the "process" tests: `mvn clean install -DargLine="-DmuteTestLogs=true"`
** The test suite for `neo4j-gremlin` is disabled by default - to turn it on: `mvn clean install -DincludeNeo4j`
* Regenerate test data (only necessary given changes to IO classes): `mvn clean install -Dio` from `tinkergraph-gremlin` directory
** If there are changes to the Gryo format, it may be necessary to generate the Grateful Dead dataset from GraphSON (see `IoDataGenerationTest.shouldWriteGratefulDead`)
* Check license headers are present: `mvn apache-rat:check`
* Build AsciiDocs (Hadoop must be running): `bin/process-docs.sh`
** Process a single AsciiDoc file: +pass:[docs/preprocessor/preprocess-file.sh `pwd`/gremlin-console/target/apache-gremlin-console-*-standalone `pwd`/docs/src/xyz.asciidoc]+
* Build JavaDocs: `mvn process-resources -Djavadoc`
* Check for Apache License headers: `mvn apache-rat:check`
* Check for newer dependencies: `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` or `mvn versions:display-plugin-updates`
* Deploy JavaDocs/AsciiDocs: `bin/publish-docs.sh svn-username`
* Integration Tests: `mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false`
* Performance Tests: `mvn verify -DskipPerformanceTests=false`

IDE Setup
^^^^^^^^^

This section refers specifically to setup within Intellij.  TinkerPop has a module called `gremlin-shaded` which contains shaded dependencies for some libraries that are widely used and tend to introduce conflicts.  To ensure that Intellij properly interprets this module after importing the Maven `pom.xml` perform the following steps:

. Build `gremlin-shaded` from the command line with `mvn clean install`.
. Right-click on the `gremlin-shaded` module in the project viewer of Intellij and select "Remove module".
. In the "Maven Projects" Tool window and click the tool button for "Reimport All Maven projects" (go to `View | Tool Windows | Maven Projects` on the main menu if this panel is not activated).
. At this point it should be possible to compile and run the tests within Intellij, but in the worst case, use `File | Invalidate Caches/Restart` to ensure that indices properly rebuild.

Note that it maybe be necessary to re-execute these steps if the `gremlin-shaded` `pom.xml` is ever updated.

Developers working on the `neo4j-gremlin` module should enabled the `include-neo4j` Maven profile in Intellij.  This will ensure that tests will properly execute within the IDE.

Issue Tracker Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TinkerPop3 uses Apache JIRA as its link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP3[issue tracker].  JIRA is a very robust piece of software with many options and configurations.  To simplify usage and ensure consistency across issues, the following conventions should be adhered to:

* An issue's "status" should generally be in one of two states: `open` or `closed` (`reopened` is equivalent to `open` for our purposes).
** An `open` issue is newly created, under consideration or otherwise in progress.
** A `closed` issue is completed for purposes of release (i.e. code, testing, and documentation complete).
** Issues in a `resolved` state should immediately be evaluated for movement to `closed` - issue become `resolved` by those who don't have the permissions to `close`.
* An issue's "type" should be one of two options: `bug` or `improvement`.
** A `bug` has a very specific meaning, referring to an error that prevents usage of TinkerPop AND does not have a reasonable workaround.  Given that definition, a `bug` should generally have very high priority for a fix.
** Everything else is an `improvement` in the sense that any other work is an enhancement to the current codebase.
* The "component" should be representative of the primary area of code that it applies to and all issues should have this property set.
* Issues are not assigned "labels".
* Until there is an official release "affected version" should be left empty.

Release Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. `mvn clean install`
.. `mvn verify -DskipIntegrationTests=false`
.. `mvn verify -DskipPerformanceTests=false`
. Perform manual tests:
.. Execute `:remote connect conf/remote.yaml` and send some requests to a running Gremlin Server instance.
.. Execute `:?` to display the help in the Console.
. Update `CHANGELOG.asciidoc` with release date
. `bin/bump.sh "version"` to update project files to reference the non-SNAPSHOT version
. `git diff` and review the updated files (expect all `pom.xml` files and this README)
. `git commit -a -m "TinkerPop x.y.z release"` and `git push`
. `git tag -a -m "TinkerPop x.y.z release" x.y.z` and `git push --tags`
. `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
. `bin/publish-docs.sh <username>`
. `mvn install -Papache-release -DcreateChecksum=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
