# JavaScript Gremlin Language Variant

[Apache TinkerPopâ„¢][tk] is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems
(OLAP). [Gremlin][gremlin] is the graph traversal language of TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional,
data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's
property graph.

Gremlin-Javascript implements Gremlin within the JavaScript language and can be used on Node.js and has experimental support for Web APIs compatible runtimes.

```bash
npm install gremlin
```

Gremlin-Javascript is designed to connect to a "server" that is hosting a TinkerPop-enabled graph system. That "server" 
could be [Gremlin Server][gs] or a [remote Gremlin provider][rgp] that exposes protocols by which Gremlin-Javascript 
can connect.

A typical connection to a server running on "localhost" that supports the Gremlin Server protocol using websockets 
looks like this:

```javascript
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const traversal = gremlin.process.AnonymousTraversalSource.traversal;
const DriverRemoteConnection = gremlin.driver.DriverRemoteConnection;

const g = traversal().with_(new DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin'));
```

Once "g" has been created using a connection, it is then possible to start writing Gremlin traversals to query the 
remote graph:

```javascript
g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList()
  .then(names => console.log(names));

const names = await g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList();
console.log(names);
```

# Sample Traversals

The Gremlin language allows users to write highly expressive graph traversals and has a broad list of functions that 
cover a wide body of features. The [Reference Documentation][steps] describes these functions and other aspects of the 
TinkerPop ecosystem including some specifics on [Gremlin in Javascript][docs] itself. Most of the examples found in the 
documentation use Groovy language syntax in the [Gremlin Console][console]. For the most part, these examples
should generally translate to Javascript with [little modification][differences]. Given the strong correspondence 
between canonical Gremlin in Java and its variants like Javascript, there is a limited amount of Javascript-specific 
documentation and examples. This strong correspondence among variants ensures that the general Gremlin reference 
documentation is applicable to all variants and that users moving between development languages can easily adopt the 
Gremlin variant for that language.

## Create Vertex

```javascript
/* if we want to assign our own ID and properties to this vertex */
const { t: { id } } = gremlin.process;
const { cardinality: { single } } = gremlin.process;

/**
 * Create a new vertex with Id, Label and properties
 * @param {String,Number} vertexId Vertex Id (assuming the graph database allows id assignment)
 * @param {String} vlabel Vertex Label
 */
const createVertex = async (vertexId, vlabel) => {
  const vertex = await g.addV(vlabel)
    .property(id, vertexId)
    .property(single, 'name', 'Apache')
    .property('lastname', 'Tinkerpop') // default database cardinality
    .next();

  return vertex.value;
};
```

## Find Vertices

```javascript
/**
 * List all vertexes in db
 * @param {Number} limit
 */
const listAll = async (limit = 500) => {
  return g.V().limit(limit).elementMap().toList();
};
/**
 * Find unique vertex with id
 * @param {Object} vertexId Vertex Id
 */
const findVertex = async (vertexId) => {
  const vertex = await g.V(vertexId).elementMap().next();
  return vertex.value;
};
/**
 * Find vertices by label and 'name' property
 * @param {String} vlabel Vertex label
 * @param {String} name value of 'name' property
 */
const listByLabelAndName = async (vlabel, name) => {
  return g.V().has(vlabel, 'name', name).elementMap().toList();
};
```

## Update Vertex
```javascript
const { cardinality: { single } } = gremlin.process;

/**
 * Update Vertex Properties
 * @param {String,Number} vertexId Vertex Id
 * @param {String} name Vertex Name Property
 */
const updateVertex = async (vertexId, label, name) => {
  const vertex = await g.V(vertexId).property(single, 'name', name).next();
  return vertex.value;
};
```

for early testing purposes only. These releases are not suitable for production.
