    <Description>Gremlin.Net for Apache TinkerPop™ is a language variant and driver for .NET.

Apache TinkerPop™ is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP). Gremlin is the graph traversal language of TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's property graph.

Gremlin.Net implements Gremlin within .NET. C# syntax has the same constructs as Java including "dot notation" for function chaining (a.b.c), round bracket function arguments (a(b,c)), and support for global namespaces (a(b()) vs a(__.b())). As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work with Gremlin.Net. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin.Net that make traversals a bit more succinct.

Gremlin.Net is designed to connect to a "server" that is hosting a TinkerPop-enabled graph system. That "server" could be Gremlin Server

https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server

or a remote graph provider that exposes protocols by which Gremlin.Net can connect.

Please see the Reference Documentation of Apache TinkerPop for more information on usage: https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference

and use our Google Group gremlin-users if there are any questions: https://s.apache.org/c8hru

The Gremlin language allows users to write highly expressive graph traversals and has a broad list of functions that cover a wide body of features. The Reference Documentation describes these functions and other aspects of the TinkerPop ecosystem including some specifics on Gremlin in .NET itself:

Most of the examples found in the documentation use Groovy language syntax in the Gremlin Console. For the most part, these examples should generally translate to C# with some logical modification:

https://s.apache.org/10v91

Given the strong correspondence between canonical Gremlin in Java and its variants like C#, there is a limited amount of C#-specific documentation and examples. This strong correspondence among variants ensures that the general Gremlin reference documentation is applicable to all variants and that users moving between development languages can easily adopt the Gremlin variant for that language.

NOTE that versions suffixed with "-rc" are considered release candidates (i.e. pre-alpha, alpha, beta, etc.) and thus for early testing purposes only.</Description>
