/**
 * A {@link VertexProgram} represents one component of a distributed graph computation. Each vertex in the graph
 * (logically) executes the {@link VertexProgram} instance in parallel. The collective behavior yields
 * the computational result. In practice, a "worker" (i.e. task, thread, etc.) is responsible for executing the
 * VertexProgram against each vertex that it has in its vertex set (a subset of the full graph vertex set).
 * At minimum there is one "worker" for each vertex, though this is impractical in practice and {@link GraphComputer}
 * implementations that leverage such a design are not expected to perform well due to the excess object creation.
 * Any local state/fields in a VertexProgram is static to the vertices within the same worker set.
 * It is not safe to assume that the VertexProgram's "worker" state will remain stable between iterations.
 * Hence, the existence of {@link VertexProgram#workerIterationStart} and {@link VertexProgram#workerIterationEnd}.
