 * The Gremlin Console supports the {@code :remote} and {@code :submit} commands which provide standardized ways

 * A "remote connection" does not necessarily have to be a remote server.  It simply refers to a resource that is
 * external to the console.
 * <p/>
 * By implementing this interface and returning an instance of it through
 * {@link ConsoleCustomizer#getRemoteAcceptor(GremlinShellEnvironment)} a plugin can hook into those commands and
 * provide remoting features.
